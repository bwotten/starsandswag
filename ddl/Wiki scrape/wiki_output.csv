Alpheratz or Sirrah or delta Peg,Alpheratz,"Alpha Andromedae (Alpha And, Î± And, Î± Andromedae), which has the traditional names Alpheratz (or Alpherat from the Arabic word Ø§Ù„ÙÅØ±Ø_) and Sirrah (or Sirah), is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda. Located immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus, it is the northeastern star of the Great Square of Pegasus. Ptolemy considered Alpha Andromedae to be shared by Pegasus, and Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations: Alpha Andromedae (Î± And) and Delta Pegasi (Î´ Peg). When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the latter designation dropped from use.It is located 97 light-years from Earth. Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star, with overall apparent visual magnitude +2.06, it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit. The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury-manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury, manganese, and other elements, including gallium and xenon. It is the brightest mercury-manganese star known."
Mirach,Mirach,"Beta Andromedae (Beta And, Î_ And, Î_ Andromedae) is the Bayer designation for a prominent star in the northern constellation of Andromeda. It has the traditional name Mirach, which is also spelled Merach, Mirac, Mirak. Î_ Andromedae is located northeast of the Great Square of Pegasus and is theoretically visible to all observers north of 54Â° S. The galaxy NGC 404, also known as Mirach's Ghost, is visible seven arc-minutes away.This star has an average apparent visual magnitude of 2.05, which makes it the brightest star in the constellation. However, the luminosity varies slightly from magnitude +2.01 to +2.10. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly 197 light-years (60 parsecs) from Earth. The apparent magnitude of this star is reduced by 0.06 from extinction caused by the gas and dust along the line of sight."
Almach,Almach,"Gamma Andromedae (Gamma And, Î_ And, Î_ Andromedae) is the third brightest point of light in the constellation of Andromeda. It is also known by the traditional name Almach (also spelt as Almaach, Almaack, Almak, Almaak, or Alamak).In 1778, Johann Tobias Mayer discovered that Î_ Andromedae was a double star. When examined in a small telescope, it appears to be a bright, golden yellow star (Î_1 Andromedae) next to a dimmer, indigo blue star (Î_2 Andromedae), separated by approximately 10 arcseconds. It is often considered by stargazers to be a beautiful double star with a striking contrast of color. It was later discovered that Î_2 Andromedae is itself a triple star system. What appears as a single star to the naked eye is thus a quadruple star system, approximately 350 light-years from the Earth."

Sadal Melik,Sadal Melik,"This is the list of notable stars in the constellation Aquarius, sorted by decreasing brightness."
Sadachbia,Sadachbia,"Gamma Aquarii (Î_ Aqr, Î_ Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a star in the constellation Aquarius. It has the traditional name Sadachbia, from an Arabic expression Ø_Ø_Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø®Ø¨Ù_Ø© saâ€˜d al-â€™axbiyah ""luck of the homes (tents)"". In Hindi it is also called Satabhishaj (a hundred physicians); Sadhayam in Tamil. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.849, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of roughly 164 light-years (50 parsecs) from the Sun, with an error margin of 5%. The star is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 58.1 days.In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Aoul al Achbiya (Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ø£Ù„Ø£Ø¬Ø¨Ù_Ø© - awwil al ahbiyah), which was translated into Latin as Prima Tabernaculorum, meaning the first of luck of the homes (tents). This star, along with Ï€ Aqr (Seat), Î¶ Aqr (Sadaltager / Achr al Achbiya) and Î· Aqr (Hydria), were al Aá¸£biyah (Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø®Ø¨Ù_Ø©), the Tent.In Chinese, å¢_å¢“ (FÃ©n MÃ_), meaning Tomb, refers to an asterism consisting of Î_ Aquarii, Î¶ Aquarii, Î· Aquarii, Ï€ Aquarii. Consequently, Î_ Aquarii itself is known as å¢_å¢“äºŒ (FÃ©n MÃ_ Ã¨r, English: the Second Star of Tomb).Gamma Aquarii is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 V, making it both larger and more massive than the Sun. It is a candidate Lambda BoÃ¶tis star, suggesting it may have accreted low-metallicity circumstellar gas some time in the past. It is spinning relatively rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 80 km sâˆ’1. This value gives a lower bound on the actual azimuthal velocity along the star's equator. The outer atmosphere of Gamma Aquarii is radiating energy at an effective temperature of 10,500 K, which is nearly double the temperature at the surface of the Sun. This heat is what gives Gamma Aquarii the white-hot glow of an A-type star."
Skat or Scheat or Seat,Skat,"Delta Aquarii (Î´ Aqr, Î´ Aquarii) is the third-brightest star in the constellation Aquarius. It has the traditional name Skat, which has also been used for Beta Pegasi. The apparent visual magnitude is 3.3, which can be seen with the naked eye. The distance to this star is estimated as 160 light-years (49 parsecs) based upon parallax measurements."
Al Bali,Al Bali,"Epsilon Aquarii (Îµ Aqr, Îµ Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial zodiac constellation of Aquarius. It has the traditional name, Albali, and is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.77. The distance to this star can be determined from parallax measurements, yielding an estimated value of around 208 light-years (64 pc) from Earth. Epsilon Aquarii is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A1 V."
Ancha,Ancha,"Theta Aquarii (Î¸ Aqr, Î¸ Aquarii) is the bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It has the traditional name Ancha; Medieval Latin for ""the haunch"". Visible to the naked eye at apparent magnitude 4.175, it is located at a distance of around 187 light-years (57 parsecs) from Earth. Since it is near the ecliptic it can be occulted by the Moon, or very rarely by planets.In Chinese, æ_£ (QÃ¬), meaning Weeping, refers to an asterism consisting of Î¸ Aquarii and ÏÅ Aquarii. Consequently, Î¸ Aquarii itself is known as æ_£äºŒ (QÃ¬ Ã¨r, English: the Second Star of Weeping.). Possibly, the name Lei meaning tears (weeping) in Chinese, was appear from the Chinese name for this starAncha belongs to the spectral class G8 with a luminosity class of IIIâ€“IV suggesting that, at an age of 437 million years, this star is part way between the subgiant and giant stages of its evolution. Estimates of the star's mass range from 2.39 to 2.78 times the Sun's mass, with a radius of about 12 times that of the Sun. It is radiating from 72 to 83 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its enlarged outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,864 K. At this heat, the star glows with the yellow hue of a G-type star."
Situla,Situla,"Kappa Aquarii (Îº Aqr, Îº Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a double star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It has the traditional name Situla, a Latin word meaning ""bucket"" or ""water jar"". This system is visible to the naked eye, but it is faint at an apparent magnitude of 5.03. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, the distance to Kappa Aquarii is around 214 light-years (66 parsecs).This is most probably a wide binary star system. The brighter component is a giant star with a stellar classification of K2 III. It has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and has expanded to 13 times the radius of the Sun. Kappa Aquarii is radiating 60 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,581 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.The fainter companion star is located at an angular separation of 98.3 arcseconds and has an apparent magnitude of 8.8."
Altair,Altair,"Altair (Î± Aquilae, Î± Aql) is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is currently in the G-cloudâ€”a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s. This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon."
Alshain,Alshain,"Beta Aquilae (Î_ Aql, Î_ Aquilae) is a star in the constellation Aquila. It has the traditional name Alshain from the Perso-Arabic term Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø§Ù‡Ù_Ù† aÅ¡-Å¡ÄÅhÄ«n ""the (peregrine) falcon"", perhaps by folk etymology from the Persian Å¡ÄÅhÄ«n tarÄÅzÅ« (or possibly Å¡ÄÅhÄ«n tara zed; see Î_ Aquilae), the Persian name for the asterism Î±, Î_ and Î_ Aquilae.In Chinese, æ__é_“ (HÃ© GÅ_), meaning River Drum, refers to an asterism consisting of Î_ Aquilae, Altair and Î_ Aql. Consequently, Î_ Aquilae itself is known as æ__é_“ä¸€ (HÃ© GÅ_ yÄ«, English: the First Star of River Drum.)In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Unuk al Ghyrab (Ø_Ù†Ù‚ Ø£Ù„ØºØ±Ø§Ø¨ - Ãºnuq al-ghuraab), which was translated into Latin as Collum Corvi, meaning the crow's neck.Beta Aquilae has magnitude 3.71 and is of spectral class G8IV. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is approximately 44.7 light years from Earth. It has a 12th magnitude optical companion, Î_ Aquilae B, which is 13 arcseconds away in the sky."
Tarazed,Tarazed,"Gamma Aquilae (Î_ Aql, Î_ Aquilae) is a star in the constellation Aquila. It has the traditional name Tarazed.

Choo or Tchou,Tchou,"Alpha Arae (Î± Arae, Î± Ara) is the second brightest star in the southern constellation of Ara. With an average apparent visual magnitude 2.93, it is readily visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. This star is close enough to the Earth that its distance can be estimated using parallax data collected during the Hipparcos mission. It is around 270 light-years (83 parsecs) away, with a 7% margin of error. The visual magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.10 magnitudes as a result of extinction from intervening gas and dust."
Hamal,Hamal,"Hamal (Î± Ari, Î± Arietis, Alpha Arietis) is the brightest star in the northern zodiacal constellation of Aries. It has the Bayer designation Î± Arietis and the Flamsteed designation of 13 Arietis. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.0, it is among the brightest stars in the night sky. Based upon parallax measurements made with Hipparcos astrometry satellite, Hamal is about 65.8 light-years (20.2 parsecs) from Earth. It is a giant star that may host an orbiting planet with a mass greater than Jupiter."
Sheratan,Sheratan,"Beta Arietis (Î_ Ari, Î_ Arietis) is a binary star system in the constellation Aries, marking the Ram's second horn."
Mesarthim,Mesarthim,"Gamma Arietis (Î_ Ari, Î_ Arietis) is the Bayer designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Aries. It has the traditional name Mesarthim, which is of obscure origin. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the two stars is 3.86, which is readily visible to the naked eye and makes this the fourth brightest member of Aries. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 19.88 mas, the distance to Gamma Arietis is approximately 164 light-years (50 parsecs).The double star nature of this system was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1664. The two components have an angular separation of 7.606 arcseconds, which can be resolved with a small telescope. The orbital period of the pair is greater than 5000 years. The brighter component, Î_Â_ Arietis, is a magnitude 4.58 B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B9 V. The secondary, Î_Â_ Arietis, is a Lambda BoÃ¶tis (chemically peculiar) star with a stellar classification of A1p Si and a magnitude of 4.64. It is classified as an Î±2 CVn type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.04 magnitudes with a period of 2.61 days."
Botein,Botein,"Delta Arietis (Î´ Ari, Î´ Arietis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Aries. It has the traditional name Botein which is derived from the Arabic word for ""belly"". The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 4.35, which is bright enough to be viewed with the naked eye. It has an annual parallax shift of 19.22 mas; corresponding to a physical distance of approximately 170 light-years (52 parsecs) from Earth.This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K2 III. It belongs to a population known as red clump giants, which means it is generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core. With close to twice the mass of the Sun, the outer envelope has expanded until it is around ten times the Sun's radius. It shines with 45 times the Sun's luminosity at an effective temperature of 4,810 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It is a suspected variable star that ranges in magnitude from 4.33 to 4.37."
Capella,Capella,"Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth brightest in the night sky and the third brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega. Its name is derived from the diminutive of the Latin feminine capra ""goat"", hence ""little she goat"". Capella also bears the Bayer designation Alpha Aurigae (often abbreviated to Î± Aurigae, Î± Aur or Alpha Aur). Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, type-G giant stars, designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 AU apart and a derived orbital period of 104 days.Capella Aa is the brighter of the two at spectral class G8III (G8 Giant) whereas Ab is slightly smaller and of spectral class G0III (G0 Giant). Aa has a calculated mass of 3.05 times that of the Sun and Ab some 2.57 times that of the Sun. These two stars have both exhausted their core hydrogen fuel and become giant stars, though it is unclear exactly what stage they are on the stellar evolutionary pathway. The second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. They are designated Capella H and Capella L. The stars labelled Capella C through to G and I through to K are actually unrelated stars in the same visual field. The Capella system is relatively close, at only 42.8 light-years (13.1 pc) from Earth."
Menkalinan,Menkalinan,"Beta Aurigae (Î_ Aur, Î_ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the traditional name Menkalinan, which is shortened from the Arabic Ù…Ù†ÙƒØ¨ Ø°Ù_ Ø§Ù„Ø_Ù†Ø§Ù† mankib Ã°Ä«-l-â€˜inÄÅn ""shoulder of the rein-holder"". It is known as äº”è»_ä¸‰ (the Third Star of the Five Chariots) in traditional Chinese astronomy. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the system is 1.9, making it the second brightest member of the constellation after Capella. Using the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, the distance to this star system can be estimated as 81.1 light-years (24.9 parsecs), give or take a half light year margin of error."
Prijipati,Prijipati,"Delta Aurigae (Î´ Aur, Î´ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for an astrometric binary star in the constellation Auriga. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.715. Based upon its annual parallax shift of 25.88 mas, it is some 126 light-years (39 parsecs) distant from the Earth, give or take an eight light-year margin of error. This star is the namesake for the Delta Aurigids, a meteor shower that occurs between October 6â€“15. The radiant point for this shower passes several degrees to the south of the star.The visible component of this system is a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It has 11 times the radius of the Sun and shines with 62 times the Sun's luminosity. This energy is being radiated from the star's outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,786 K. This heat gives the star the orange-hued glow of a K-type star."
Maaz,Maaz,"Epsilon Aurigae (Îµ Aur, Îµ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Auriga. It is traditionally known as Almaaz, Haldus, or Al Anz. Epsilon Aurigae is an unusual eclipsing binary system comprising an F0 supergiant and a companion which is generally accepted to be a huge dark disk orbiting an unknown object, possibly a binary system of two small B-type stars. About every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae's brightness drops from an apparent visual magnitude of +2.92 to +3.83. This dimming lasts 640â€“730 days. In addition to this eclipse, the system also has a low amplitude pulsation with a non-consistent period of around 66 days. The distance to the system is still a subject of debate, but modern estimates place it approximately 2,000 light years from Earth.Epsilon Aurigae was first suspected to be a variable star when German astronomer Johann Heinrich Fritsch observed it in 1821. Later observations by Eduard Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander reinforced Fritsch's initial suspicions and attracted attention to the star. Hans Ludendorff, however, was the first to study it in great detail. His work revealed that the system was an eclipsing binary variable, a star that dims when its partner obscures its light.Epsilon Aurigae's eclipsing companion has been subject to much debate since the object does not emit as much light as is expected for an object its size. As of 2008, the most popularly accepted model for this companion object is a binary star system surrounded by a massive, opaque disk of dust; theories speculating that the object is a large, semitransparent star or a black hole have since been discarded."
Sadatoni,Sadatoni,"Zeta Aurigae (Î¶ Aur, Î¶ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the traditional names Haedus and Sadatoni. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this system is approximately 790 light-years (240 parsecs) distant from the Earth. It has a combined apparent visual magnitude of 3.75, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.This is an eclipsing binary system with the orbital plane being oriented close to the line of sight from the Earth; the inclination of this system is estimated as 87.0Â°. As a result, an eclipse of one star by the other occurs during each orbit, causing the magnitude to decrease to +3.99. The pair have an orbital period of 972 days (2.66 years) and an eccentricity of 0.4. The primary component has been categorized as a K-type bright giant or supergiant star. Its companion is a B-type main sequence star of stellar classification B5 V or B7 V."
Kabdhilinan,Kabdhilinan,"Iota Aurigae (Î_ Aur, Î_ Aurigae) is a star in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the traditional name Al Kab, short for Kabdhilinan, from the Arabic Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ_Ø¨ Ø°Ù_ Ø§Ù„Ø_Ù†Ø§Ù† al-kacb Ã°Ä«l-cinÄÅn ""the shoulder of the rein holder (charioteer)"". Under the name Alkab, this star is a marker on the astrolabe described by Geoffrey Chaucer in his Treatise on the Astrolabe in 1391. In AntonÃ_n BeÄçvÃ¡Å™'s atlas it has the traditional name Hassaleh. It is known as äº”è»_ä¸€ (the First Star of the Five Chariots) in Chinese.This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.7, which is bright enough to be readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements give a distance estimate of roughly 490 light-years (150 parsecs) from the Earth. At this distance, extinction from interstellar dust is causing a magnitude reduction of about 0.6. Examination of the spectrum yields a stellar classification of K3 II, with the luminosity class of 'II' indicating this is a category of evolved star known as a bright giant. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 4,160 K, which is cooler than the Sun's effective temperature and gives Iota Aurigae the orange hue of a K-type star.This star is a weak X-ray emitter with an X-ray luminosity of about 1.8 Ã— 1027 ergs sâˆ’1. This emission is most likely coming from transient loops of plasma in Iota Aurigae's outer atmosphere, which have a temperature of around 3 million K. This is a suspected variable star, although this variability remains unconfirmed."
Arcturus,Arcturus,"Arcturus (/É‘ËêrkËˆtjÊ_É™rÉ™s/; Î± Boo, Î± BoÃ¶tis, Alpha BoÃ¶tis) of the constellation BoÃ¶tes is the brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. With a visual magnitude of âˆ’0.05, it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after âˆ’1.46 magnitude Sirius, âˆ’0.86 magnitude Canopus, and âˆ’0.27 magnitude Alpha Centauri. It is a relatively close star at only 36.7 light-years from Earth, and, together with Vega and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.Arcturus is a type K0 III orange giant star, with an absolute magnitude of âˆ’0.30. It has likely exhausted its hydrogen from its core and is now in its active hydrogen shell burning phase. It will continue to expand before entering horizontal branch stage of its life cycle."
Nekkar or Nakkar,Nekkar,"Beta BoÃ¶tis (Î_ Boo, Î_ BoÃ¶tis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of BoÃ¶tes. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.5, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. The traditional name Nakkar or Nekkar for this star is based upon the Arabic name for the constellation. This is a mis-transliteration of the Arabic Ø¨Ù‚Ù‘Ø§Ø± baqqÄÅr ""cattle driver"", the Arabic letters b and n differing only in the placement of the dot. In the modern constellation, it marks the head of BoÃ¶tis the herdsman. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is approximately 225 light-years (69 parsecs) from Earth. At that distance, the magnitude of the star is reduced by 0.06 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.Nakkar has more than three times the mass of the Sun and greater than 21 times the Sun's radius. (KÃ¶nig et al. (2006) give it 3.4 solar masses, while Tetzlaff et al. (2011) list a higher estimated mass of 5.0 Â± 1.5 solar masses and Takeda et al. (2008) show it as 3.24 solar masses.) At the estimated age of 240â€“251 million years, it has evolved into a giant star with a stellar classification of G8 IIIa. The star is radiating around 170â€“194 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,932 K. This heat gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. It has an estimated rotation period of about 200 days and the pole is inclined 28Â° Â± 6Â° to the line of sight from the Earth.In 1993, the ROSAT satellite was used to observe an X-ray flare on Beta BoÃ¶tis, which released an estimated 1.7 Ã— 1032 erg. This was the first such observation for a low-activity star of this type. The flare may be explained by an as yet unobserved M-type dwarf companion star."
Seginus,Seginus,"Gamma BoÃ¶tis (Î_ Boo, Î_ BoÃ¶tis) is a star in the constellation BoÃ¶tes. It has the traditional name Seginus (also Segin, Ceginus) of uncertain origin. It was listed as Haris in BeÄçvÃ¡Å™."
Mirak  Izar  or Pulcherrima,Mirak  Izar,"Epsilon BoÃ¶tis (Îµ Boo, Îµ BoÃ¶tis) is a double star in the northern constellation of BoÃ¶tes. It has the traditional name Izar and was named Pulcherrima (most beautiful) by Otto Struve. The star system can be viewed with the unaided eye at night, but resolving the pair with a small telescope is challenging; an aperture of 76 mm (3.0 in) or greater is required."
Muphrid,Muphrid,"Eta BoÃ¶tis (Î· Boo, Î· BoÃ¶tis) is a star in the constellation BoÃ¶tes. It has the traditional names Muphrid and Saak, and the Flamsteed designation 8 BoÃ¶tis. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.The name Muphrid is from the Arabic Ù…ÙÅØ±Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø§Ù…Ø_ mufrid ar-rÄÅmiÄ§ ""the (single) one of the lancer"". In Chinese, åè_æ”ùæèê (YÃ_u NiÃ¨ DÄ«), meaning ""the Right Conductor"", refers to an asterism consisting of Eta BoÃ¶tis, Tau BoÃ¶tis and Upsilon BoÃ¶tis. Consequently, Eta BoÃ¶tis itself is known as åè_æ”ùæèêä¸€ (YÃ_u NiÃ¨ DÄ« yÄ«, English: ""the First Star of the Right Conductor""). In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Ramih al Ramih (Ø±Ù…Ø_ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø§Ù…Ø_â€”rumá¸¥ al rÄÅmiá¸¥), which was translated into Latin as Lancea Lanceator, possibly meaning the lance of the lancer.This star is a subgiant that has begun the process of evolving from a main sequence star into a red giant. It has about 1.7 times the mass of the Sun and 2.7 times the Sun's radius. The estimated age of this star is about 2.7 billion years. Based on its spectra, Eta BoÃ¶tis has a significant excess of elements heavier than helium. In fact the ratio of iron to hydrogen is considered close to the upper limit for dwarf stars in the galactic disk. The star is a suspected spectroscopic binary with a reported period of 494 days, but the companion was not confirmed through speckle interferometry. This measurement does not rule out a low mass stellar companion of spectral class M7.Eta BoÃ¶tis appears close to the prominent star Arcturus (Alpha Bootis) in Earth's sky, and Arcturus is in fact its closest stellar neighbor, as both stars are nearly identical in distance from the Sun. The two stars are about 3.24 light years apart, and each would appear bright in the other's sky. Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta BoÃ¶tis, while Eta BoÃ¶tis would appear at about magnitude âˆ’2.4 (absolute magnitude âˆ’2.41 at 0.99 parsec)) in the sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in our night sky."

Cor Caroli,Caroli,"USS Cor Caroli (AK-91) was an Crater-class cargo ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy for service in World War II, named after Cor Caroli, the brightest star in constellation Canes Venatici. She was responsible for delivering goods and equipment to locations in the war zone.Cor Caroli (AK-91) was launched 19 March 1943 as SS Betsy Ross by Permanente Metals Corp., Yard No. 2, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. F. Modglin; acquired by the Navy 31 March 1943; commissioned 16 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander J. A. Lewis, USCGR, in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet."
Sirius,Sirius,"Sirius (/ËˆsÉªriÉ™s/) is the brightest star (in fact, a star system) in the Earth's night sky. With a visual apparent magnitude of âˆ’1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The name ""Sirius"" is derived from the Ancient Greek Î£ÎµÎ¯ÏÅÎ_Î¿Ï‚ (Seirios), meaning ""glowing"" or ""scorcher"". The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (Î± CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.Sirius appears bright because of both its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbors. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's sky for the next 210,000 years.Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun (Mâ˜‰) and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.Sirius is also known colloquially as the ""Dog Star"", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Greater Dog). The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the ""dog days"" of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians in the Southern Hemisphere the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean."
Mirzam,Mirzam,"Beta Canis Majoris (Î_ CMa, Î_ Canis Majoris) is a star in the southern constellation of Canis Major, the 'greater dog', and is located at a distance of about 500 light-years (150 parsecs) from the Earth. In the modern constellation it lies at the position of the dog's head. It has the traditional name Murzim, Al-Murzim or Mirzam, which is derived from the Arabic (Ù…Ø±Ø_Ù…) for 'The Herald', and probably refers to its position, heralding Sirius in the night sky (i.e., rising before it).In Chinese, è»çå¸‚ (JÅ«n ShÃ¬), meaning Market for Soldiers, refers to an asterism consisting of Î_ Canis Majoris, Î_3 Canis Majoris, 15 Canis Majoris, Ï€ Canis Majoris, Î¿1 Canis Majoris and Î_1 Canis Majoris. Consequently, Î_ Canis Majoris itself is known as è»çå¸‚ä¸€ (JÅ«n ShÃ¬ yÄ«, English: the First Star of Market for Soldiers). From this Chinese name arose the name Kuen She.The Dunhuang Star Chart noted Î_ Canis Majoris as Yeji ""Pheasant Cock"", though was located about 10 degrees too far north of its correct position."
Muliphein,Muliphein,"Gamma Canis Majoris (Î_ CMa, Î_ Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major. It has the traditional name Muliphein, not to be confused with Muhlifain, which is Gamma Centauri; both names derive from the same Arabic root, Ù…Ø_Ù„ÙÅÙ_Ù† muÄ§lifayn. It is unclear exactly why this relatively faint star was given the ""gamma"" designation, but it is possibly because it is in the same part of the constellation as Sirius (alpha) and Murzim (beta).Î_ Canis Majoris is a blue-white B-type bright giant with a stellar classification of B8II and an apparent magnitude of +4.11. It is approximately 440 light years from Earth. It is a chemically peculiar Hg-Mg star displaying abnormal lines of mercury and magnesium. This star has 5.6 times the radius of the Sun and the outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 13,596 K.This star is suspected of being a spectroscopic binary system, and there is a candidate companion at an angular separation of 0.332â€_ along a position angle of 114.8Â°. It is a member of the Collander 121 open cluster."

Adhara,Adhara,"Epsilon Canis Majoris (Îµ CMa, Îµ Canis Majoris) is the second brightest star in the constellation Canis Major, and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation ""epsilon"" despite being the second brightest and not the fifth brightest star in its constellation. It has the traditional name Adhara (sometimes spelled Adara). The name is from the Arabic word Ø_Ø°Ø§Ø±Ù‰ â€˜aÃ°ÄÅraâ€™, ""virgins"". It was once the brightest star in the sky, with an apparent magnitude of -3.99.In Chinese, å_§çŸ¢ (HÃº ShÇê), meaning Bow and Arrow, refers to an asterism consisting of Îµ Canis Majoris, Î´ Canis Majoris, Î· Canis Majoris, HD 63032, HD 65456, Î¿ Puppis, k Puppis, Îº Canis Majoris and Ï€ Puppis. Consequently, Îµ Canis Majoris itself is known as å_§çŸ¢ä¸ƒ (HÃº ShÇê qÄ«, English: the Seventh Star of Bow and Arrow.)In the 17th century catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Aoul al Adzari (Ø£ÙˆÙ„ Ø£Ù„Ø_Ø°Ø§Ø±Ù_ - awwil al-aÃ°ÄÅrii), which was translated into Latin as Prima Virginum, meaning First of the Virgins. Along with Î´ CMa (Wezen), Î· CMa (Aludra) and Î¿2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), these stars were Al Ê_AdhÄÅrÄÅ (Ø£Ù„Ø_Ø°Ø§Ø±Ù_), the Virgins."
Furud,Furud,"Zeta Canis Majoris (Î¶ CMa, Î¶ Canis Majoris) is a spectroscopic binary in the constellation Canis Major. It has the traditional name Furud or Phurud, from the Arabic Ø£Ù„ÙÅØ±Ø¯ al-furud meaning the bright single ones or, perhaps by a transcriber's error, from Al á¸_urÅ«d (Ø£Ù„Ù‚Ø±Ø¯ - al-qird), the Apes, or Al Agribah (Ø£Ù„ Ø£ØºØ±Ø¨Ø©), the Raven by Al Sufi, referring to the surrounding small stars with some of those of Columba (Î¶ CMa, Î» CMa, Î_ Col, Î´ Col, Î¸ Col, Îº Col, Î» Col, Î_ Col and Î_ Col). The Bayer designation Zeta Canis Majoris was assigned by German astronomer Johann Bayer in 1603.This star system has an apparent visual magnitude of +3.0, making it one of the brighter stars in the constellation and hence readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission yield a distance estimate of around 362 ly (111 pc) from Earth. This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system, which means that the pair have not been individually resolved with a telescope, but the gravitational perturbations of an unseen astrometric companion can be discerned by shifts in the spectrum of the primary caused by the Doppler effect. The pair orbit around their common center of mass once every 675 days with an eccentricity of 0.57.The primary component is a large star with nearly four times the Sun's radius and almost eight times the mass of the Sun. It has a stellar classification of B2.5 V, which means it is a B-type main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. It is emitting 3,603 times the luminosity of the Sun and is a suspected Beta Cephei variable. This energy is being radiated from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of about 18,700 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. It is relatively young for a star, with an estimated age of 32 million years."
Aludra,Aludra,"Eta Canis Majoris (Î· CMa, Î· Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major. It has the traditional name Aludra. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.The name Aludra originates from the Arabic: Ø_Ø°Ø±Ø§ al-â€˜aÃ°rÄÅ ""the virgin"". This star, along with Îµ CMa (Adhara), Î´ CMa (Wezen) and Î¿2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), were Al Ê_AdhÄÅrÄÅ (Ø£Ù„Ø_Ø°Ø§Ø±Ù_), the Virgins.In Chinese, å_§çŸ¢ (HÃº ShÇê), meaning Bow and Arrow, refers to an asterism consisting of Î· Canis Majoris, Î´ Canis Majoris, HD 63032, HD 65456, Î¿ Puppis, k Puppis, Îµ Canis Majoris, Îº Canis Majoris and Ï€ Puppis. Consequently, Î· Canis Majoris itself is known as å_§çŸ¢äºŒ (HÃº ShÇê Ã¨r, English: the Second Star of Bow and Arrow.)"
Procyon,Procyon,"Canis Minor /ËŒkeÉªnáµ»s ËˆmaÉªnÉ™r/ is a small constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and it is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for ""lesser dog"", in contrast to Canis Major, the ""greater dog""; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter.Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, as well as one of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December."
Gomeisa,Gomeisa,"Beta Canis Minoris (Î_ CMi, Î_ Canis Minoris) is a star in the constellation of Canis Minor. In the night sky it is notable for its proximity to the prominent star Procyon.

Beta Carinae also has the traditional name Miaplacidus, meaning ""placid waters"". It lies near the planetary nebula IC 2448. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of 113.2 light-years (34.7 parsecs) from Earth.Beta Carinae's traditional name Miaplacidus made its debut on star maps in 1856 when the star atlas Geography of the Heavens, composed by Elijah Hinsdale Burritt, was published. The meaning and linguistic origin of the name remained an enigma for many decades, until William Higgins, a great scholar and expert on star names, surmised that the name Miaplacidus is apparently a bilingual combination of Arabic Ù…Ù_Ø§Ù‡ miyÄÅh for ""waters"" and Latin placidus for ""placid"".In Chinese, åç—èˆ_ (NÃ¡n ChuÃ¡n), meaning Southern Boat, refers to an asterism consisting of Î_ Carinae, V337 Carinae, PP Carinae, Î¸ Carinae and Ï‰ Carinae . Consequently, Î_ Carinae itself is known as åç—èˆ_äº” (NÃ¡n ChuÃ¡n wÇ”, English: the Fifth Star of Southern Boat.)The stellar classification of A1 IIIâ€“ suggests this is an evolved giant star, although Malagnini and Morossi (1990) rated it as an A2 IV subgiant star. It has an estimated age of 260 million years. This star does not show an excess emission of infrared radiation that might otherwise suggest the presence of a debris disk. It has about 3.5 times the Sun's mass and has expanded to almost seven times the radius of the Sun.

Rigel Kentaurus or Rigilkent,Rigel Kentaurus,"Alpha Centauri (Î± Cen), also known as Rigil Kent (/ËˆraÉªdÊ’É™l ËˆkÉ›nt/) (the ""Centaur's Foot"") or Toliman, is the closest star system to the Solar System at 4.37 ly (1.34 pc). It consists of three stars: the pair Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, Alpha Centauri C, better known as Proxima Centauri, that may be gravitationally bound to the other two. (Beta Centauri, or Î_ Centauri, should not be confused with Alpha Centauri B, and is a separate, trinary, system of its own.)  To the unaided eye, the two main components appear as a single object of an apparent visual magnitude of âˆ’0.27, forming the brightest star in the southern constellation Centaurus and the third-brightest star in the night sky, only outshone by Sirius and Canopus.Alpha Centauri A (Î± Cen A) has 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B (Î± Cen B) is smaller and cooler, at 90.7% of the Sun's mass and 44.5% of its visual luminosity. During the pair's 79.91-year orbit about a common center, the distance between them varies from about that between Pluto and the Sun to that between Saturn and the Sun. Proxima is at the slightly smaller distance of 1.29 parsecs or 4.24 light years from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about 0.06 parsecs, 0.2 light years or 15,000 astronomical units (AU), equivalent to 500 times the size of Neptune's orbit."
Muhlifain,Muhlifain,"Gamma Centauri (Î_ Cen, Î_ Centauri) is a star in the southern constellation Centaurus. It has the proper name Muhlifain, not to be confused with Muliphein, which is Î_ Canis Majoris; both names derive from the same Arabic root.Gamma Centauri is a double star located about 130 light-years (40 parsecs) from Earth. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the pair is +2.17, although individually they are third magnitude stars. The stellar classification of the pair is A1IV+, suggesting they are A-type subgiant stars in the process of becoming giants. Individually, their stellar classifications are sometimes listed as A0III, which would mean they have already become giants.In 2000, the pair had an angular separation of 1.217 arcseconds with a position angle of 351.9Â°. Their positions have been observed since 1897, which is long enough to estimate an orbital period of 84.5 years and a semimajor axis of 0.93 arcseconds. At the distance of this system, this is equivalent to a linear distance of about 93 Astronomical Units. The star Tau Centauri is relatively close to Gamma Centauri, with an estimated separation of 1.72 light-years (0.53 pc)."
Menkent,Menkent,"Theta Centauri (Î¸ Cen, Î¸ Centauri) is a star in the southern constellation of Centaurus, the centaur.

Acamar,Acamar,"Theta Eridani (Î¸ Eri, Î¸ Eridani) is a star in the constellation Eridanus. It has the traditional name Acamar from the Arabic Ø¢Ø®ÙêØ± Ø§Ù„Ù†Ù_Ù‘Ù‡Ù’Ø± Ä€khir an-nahr which means ""the end of the river"". Historically, Acamar represented the end of the constellation Eridanus. Now that distinction is held by the star Achernar, a star which shares the same Arabic etymology. Achernar is not visible from the Greek isles (latitudes > 33Â° North), hence the choice of Acamar as the river's end during the time of Hipparchus and later Ptolemy.The term Ä€khir an-nahr or Achr al Nahr was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as Postrema Fluminis.In Chinese, å_©åœ’ (TiÄÅn YuÃ¡n), meaning Celestial Orchard, refers to an asterism consisting of Î¸ Eridani, Ï‡ Eridani, Ï† Eridani, Îº Eridani, HD 16754, HD 23319, HD 24072, HD 24160, Ï…4 Eridani, 43 Eridani, Ï…2 Eridani and Ï…1 Eridani. Consequently, Î¸ Eridani itself is known as å_©åœ’å…_ (TiÄÅn YuÃ¡n liÃ_, English: the Sixth Star of Celestial Orchard.)Acamar is a double star with some evidence suggesting it is part of a multiple star system. The main star, Î¸1 Eri, is of the spectral class A4 and has a +3.2 apparent magnitude. Its companion star, Î¸2 Eri, is of the spectral class A1 and has an apparent magnitude of +4.3. The angular separation of the two stars is equal to 8.3 arcseconds. Acamar's distance from Earth as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite is approximately 120 light-years.Ptolemy described Acamar as a first-magnitude star, which some have taken to be in fact Achernar, which today appears just above the horizon in Alexandria where Ptolemy lived.Achernar, however, was not visible to Ptolemy (it is from Alexandria today due to precession); its declination in 100CE was -67, making it invisible even at Aswan. Ptolemy's Eridanus thus without doubt ended at Acamar, which rose about 10 degrees above the horizon from Alexandria. This fact besides positively identifying Acamar as the original ""end of the river"", also strengthens the case for Acamar having been first magnitude in ancient times."

Arneb,Arneb,"Alpha Leporis (Î± Lep, Î± Leporis) is the brightest star in the constellation Lepus. It has the traditional name Arneb, from the Arabic Ø£Ø±Ù†Ø¨ â€™arnab ""hare"".This is a massive star with about 14 times the mass of the Sun. The interferometer-measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is 1.77 Â± 0.09 mas. At an estimated distance of 2,218 light-years (680 parsecs), this yields a physical size of about 129 times the radius of the Sun. Alpha Leporis has a stellar classification of F0 Ib, with the Ib luminosity class indicating that it is a lower luminosity supergiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is about 6,850 K, which gives the star a yellow-white hue that is typical of F-type stars. It is an estimated 13 million years old.Alpha Leporis is an older, dying star that may have already passed through a supergiant phase and is now contracting and heating up in the latter phases of stellar evolution, or perhaps is still expanding into the supergiant phase. Based upon its estimated mass, it is expected to end its life in a spectacular stellar explosion known as a supernova."
Zuben El Genubi,Zuben El Genubi,"Alpha Librae (Î± Lib, Î± Librae), or Zubenelgenubi, is the second brightest star in the constellation Libra (despite its Bayer designation as alpha). Alpha2 Librae is 0.33 degree from the ecliptic so it can be easily occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. The next occultation by a planet will be by Mercury on 10 November 2052."
Zuben Eschamali,Zuben Eschamali,"Beta Librae (Î_ Lib, Î_ Librae), or Zubeneschamali, is the brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Libra. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.6. From parallax measurements, its distance can be estimated as 185 light-years (57 parsecs) from Earth."
Zubenhakrabi or Zubanalakrab,Zubenhakrabi,"Sigma Librae (Ïƒ Lib, Ïƒ Librae) is a star in the constellation Libra. The apparent visual magnitude is +3.29, making it a third magnitude star that is visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is at a distance of roughly 288 light-years (88 parsecs) from Earth, with a 2% margin of error. At that distance, the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.20 Â± 0.17 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust."
Vega,Vega,"Vega (Î± Lyr, Î± Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae) is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is a relatively close star at only 25 light-years from Earth, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed ""arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun."" Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86Â°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.Based on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars."
Sheliak or Shelyak,Sheliak,"USS Sheliak (AKA-62) was an Andromeda-class attack cargo ship named after Beta Lyrae, a binary star system in the constellation Lyra. She was one of a handful of AKA's manned by a Coast Guard crew. USS Sheliak served as a commissioned ship for 17 months.Sheliak (AKA-62) was laid down on 19 June 1944 under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 214) by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, N.J.; launched on 17 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Nellie Blanch Regan; and commissioned on 1 December 1944, Comdr. Searcy J. Lowery, USCG, in command."
Sulafat,Sulafat,"Gamma Lyrae (Î_ Lyr, Î_ Lyrae) is the second brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. It has the traditional names Sulafat (Sulaphat), from the Arabic Ø§Ù„Ø_Ù„Ø_ÙÅØ§Ø© al-sulá¸¥afÄÅt ""turtle"", and Jugum, from the Latin iugum ""yoke"". The connection with turtles is that fine harps were traditionally made of tortoiseshell. The apparent visual magnitude of Sulafat is 3.3, which is readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of 620 light-years (190 parsecs) from the Earth.This is a giant star with a stellar classification of B9 III, indicating it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. The effective temperature of the outer envelope of this star is 10,080 K, giving it the blue-white hue typical of a B-type star. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star is 0.74 Â± 0.10 mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of roughly 15 times the radius of the Sun.In 1909, Canadian astronomer Samuel A. Mitchell identified this star as a spectroscopic binary, although he was unable to split the absorption lines of the components. He found that a period of 25.6 days matched his measurements. It was reported as a spectroscopic binary as recently as 2001, but is now believed to be a single star with a high rate of rotation for stars of this type.In China, æ_¸åè° (JiÄÅntÄÅi), meaning Clepsydra Terrace, refers to an asterism consisting of this star, Î´2 Lyrae, Î_ Lyrae and Î_ Lyrae. Consequently, Î_ Lyrae itself is known as æ_¸åè°ä¸‰ (JiÄÅntÄÅisÄÅn, English: the Third Star of Clepsydra Terrace.)"
Aladfar,Aladfar,"Eta Lyrae (Î· Lyr, Î· Lyrae) is a star in the constellation Lyra. It has the traditional name Aladfar, from the Arabic Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¸ÙÅØ± al-â€™uzÌ§fur ""the talons (of the swooping eagle)"", a name it shares with Mu Lyrae (though the latter is typically spelled Alathfar in English).Eta Lyrae belongs to spectral class B2.5IV and has apparent magnitude of +4.40. It is approximately 1390 light years from Earth."

Ras Alhague,Ras Alhague,"Alpha Ophiuchi (Î± Oph, Î± Ophiuchi) is the brightest star in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the traditional name Ras Alhague, often condensed to Rasalhague.Alpha Ophiuchi is a binary star system with an orbital period of about 8.62 years. The orbital parameters were only poorly known until 2011 when observations using adaptive optics produced a better orbital fit, allowing the individual masses of the two components to be determined. The primary component, Alpha Ophiuchi A, has a mass of about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun, while the secondary, Alpha Ophiuchi B, has 0.85 solar masses. Estimates of the mass of the primary by other means range from a low of 1.92 to 2.10 solar masses, up to 2.84 or even 4.8 solar masses. The mass of the secondary suggests that it has a stellar classification in the range K5V to K7V, which indicates it is a main sequence star that is still generating energy by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The pair reached periastron passage, or closest approach, around April 19, 2012, when they had an angular separation of 50 milliarcseconds.This star system has a combined apparent magnitude of +2.08 and is located at a distance of about 48.6 light-years (14.9 parsecs) from the Earth. The stellar classification of A5 III indicates that the primary is a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence after consuming the hydrogen at its core. It is radiating about 25 times the luminosity of the Sun and has an effective temperature of about 8,000 K, giving it the characteristic white hue of an A-type star.Alpha Ophiuchi A is a rapidly rotating star with a projected rotational velocity of 240 km sâˆ’1. It is spinning at a rate of about 88.5% of the velocity that would cause the star to break up. The resulting equatorial bulge is about 20% larger than the polar radius, giving the star the shape of an oblate spheroid. Because of this distorted shape, the poles have an effective temperature about 1,840 K greater than along the equator. The axis of rotation of the star is inclined about 87.Â°7 Â± 0Â°4 to the line of sight from the Earth, so that it is being observed from nearly equator-on.The spectrum of Alpha Ophiuchi shows an anomalously high level of absorption of the lines for singly-ionized calcium (Ca II). However, this is likely the result of interstellar matter between the Earth and the star, rather than a property of the star or circumstellar dust."
Cheleb or Celbalrai,Cheleb,"Beta Ophiuchi (Î_ Oph, Î_ Ophiuchi) is a star in the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus. It has the traditional names Celbalrai, which comes from the Arabic ÙƒÙ„Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø§Ø_Ù_ kalb al-rÄÅâ€˜Ä« meaning ""shepherd dog"". It is also called Cheleb, Kelb Alrai, or sometimes just Alrai. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.7, which is readily visible to the naked eye even from urban skies. The distance to this star can be estimated using parallax measurements, yielding a value of 81.8 light-years (25.1 parsecs).This is a giant star with a stellar classification of K2 III. Although it is only 13% greater in mass than the Sun, it has reached a stage in its evolution where the atmosphere has expanded to about 12 times the Sun's radius and is radiating 63 times the luminosity of the Sun. Its outer envelope is relatively cool with an effective temperature of 4,467 K, giving it the orange hue typical of K-type stars. Like some other K-type giants, Î_ Ophiuchi has been found to vary very slightly (0.02 magnitudes) in brightness.,Cebalrai is a member of the thin disk population. It is following a low eccentricity orbit through the Milky Way galaxy that carries it between a distance of 27.3â€“30.9 kly (8.4â€“9.5 kpc) from the Galactic Center and up to 0.62 kly (0.19 kpc) above or below the galactic plane."
Sabik,Sabik,"Eta Ophiuchi, also known as Î· Oph or Î· Ophiuchi, is a star in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the traditional name Sabik."
Marfik,Marfik,"Lambda Ophiuchi (Î» Oph, Î» Ophiuchi) is a binary star system in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the traditional name Marfik (or ""Marsik""), meaning ""the elbow"" in Arabic.Lambda Ophiuchi belongs to spectral class A1V+A and has apparent magnitude +3.82. It is approximately 166 light years from Earth."
Betelgeuse,Betelgeuse,"Betelgeuse, also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Orionis (shortened to Î± Orionis or Î± Ori), is the ninth-brightest star in the night sky and second-brightest in the constellation of Orion. Distinctly reddish, it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.0 and 1.3, the widest range of any first-magnitude star. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle, and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon. The star's name is derived from the Arabic Ø¥Ø¨Ø· Ø§Ù„Ø¬ÙˆØ_Ø§Ø¡ Ibt al-JauzÄÅ' or Ù_Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¬ÙˆØ_Ø§Ø¡ Yad al-JauzÄÅ', meaning ""the hand of Orion"".The star is classified as a red supergiant of spectral type M1-2 and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained, but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun. Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light-years, yielding a mean absolute magnitude of about âˆ’6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Associationâ€”which includes the stars in Orion's Beltâ€”this crimson runaway has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova within the next million years. An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.In 1920, Betelgeuse became the second star (after the Sun) to have the angular size of its photosphere measured. Since then, researchers have used telescopes with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant, often with conflicting results. Studies since 1990 have produced an angular diameter (apparent size) ranging from 0.043 to 0.056 arcseconds, an incongruity largely caused by the star's tendency to periodically change shape. Due to limb darkening, variability, and angular diameters that vary with wavelength, many of the star's properties are not yet known with any certainty. Adding to these challenges, the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex, asymmetric envelope roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by colossal mass loss."
Rigel,Rigel,"Rigel, also known by its Bayer designation Beta Orionis (Î_ Ori, Î_ Orionis), is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the night sky, with visual magnitude 0.13. The star as seen from Earth is actually a triple or quadruple star system, with the primary star (Rigel A) a blue-white supergiant that is estimated to be anywhere from 120,000 to 279,000 times as luminous as the Sun, depending on method used to calculate its properties. It has exhausted its core hydrogen and swollen out to between 79 and 115 times the Sun's radius. It pulsates quasi-periodically and is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable. A companion, Rigel B, is 500 times fainter than the supergiant Rigel A and visible only with a telescope. Rigel B is itself a spectroscopic binary system, consisting of two main sequence blue-white stars of spectral type B9V that are estimated to be respectively 3.9 and 2.9 times as massive as the Sun. Rigel B also appears to have a very close visual companion Rigel C of almost identical appearance."
Bellatrix,Bellatrix,"Bellatrix, also known by its Bayer designation Gamma Orionis (Î_ Ori, Î_ Orionis), is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion, 5Â° right of the red giant Î± Ori (Betelgeuse). Just between the 1st and 2nd magnitude, it is the 27th brightest star in the night sky."
Mintaka,Mintaka,"Mintaka is a star some 1,200 light years distant in the constellation Orion. It has a Bayer designation of Delta Orionis (Î´ Ori) and a Flamsteed designation of 34 Orionis. The name Mintaka comes from Ù…Ù†Ø·Ù‚Ø© maná__aqa, which means ""the belt"" in Arabic. Together with Alnitak (Zeta Orionis) and Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis), the three stars make up the belt of Orion, known by many names among ancient cultures. When Orion is close to the meridian, Mintaka is the right-most of the belt's stars as seen by an observer in the Northern Hemisphere facing south."
Alnilam,Alnilam,"Alnilam is a large blue supergiant star some 1,340 light years distant in the constellation of Orion. It has a Bayer designation of Epsilon Orionis (Îµ Ori) and its Flamsteed designation is 46 Orionis. It is estimated to be 275,000 to 537,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and around 34 times as massive."
Alnitak,Alnitak,"Alnitak (Arabic: Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø·Ø§Ù‚ an-niá__ÄÅqâ€_) is a multiple star several hundred parsecs away in the constellation Orion. It is part of Orion's Belt along with Alnilam and Mintaka, and has a Bayer designation of Zeta Orionis (Î¶ Ori) and a Flamsteed designation of 50 Orionis.The primary star is a hot blue supergiant with an absolute magnitude of -6.0 and is the brightest class O star in the night sky with a visual magnitude of +2.0. It has two bluish 4th magnitude companions, one finely resolved and one only detected interferometrically and spectroscopically, producing a combined magnitude for the trio of +1.77. The stars are members of the Orion OB1 association and the Collinder 70 association."
Na'ir al Saif,Na'ir al Saif,"Iota Orionis (Î_ Ori, Î_ Orionis) is a star in the equatorial constellation of Orion the hunter. The apparent visual magnitude of Iota Orionis is 2.77, making it the eighth brightest member of Orion.Iota Orionis is the brightest star in an asterism known as Orion's sword. It has the traditional names Hatsya or Hatysa and in Arabic, Naâ€™ir al Saif, which means simply ""the Bright One of the Sword."" From parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly 1,330 light-years (410 parsecs) from Earth.Iota Orionis is a quadruple system dominated by a massive spectroscopic binary with an eccentric (e=0.764), 29-day orbit. The two components of Î_ Ori A are a stellar class O9 III star (blue giant) and a class B0.8 III/IV star about 2 magnitudes fainter. The collision of the stellar winds from this pair makes the system a strong X-ray source. Oddly, the two objects of this system appear to have different ages, with the secondary being about double the age of the primary. In combination with the high eccentricity of their orbit, this suggests that the binary system was created through a capture, rather than by being formed together and undergoing a mass transfer. This capture may have occurred, for example, through an encounter between two binary systems.Î_ Ori has a B8 giant companion at 11"" (approximately 5,000 AU) which has been shown to be variable, and likely to be a young stellar object. There is also a fainter A0 star at 49"" catalogued as Î_ Ori C."
Saiph,Saiph,"Saiph (Îº Orionis, 53 Orionis) is the sixth-brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Of the four bright stars that compose Orion's main quadrangle, it is the star at the south-eastern corner. A northern-hemisphere observer facing south would see it at the lower left of Orion, and a southern-hemisphere observer facing north would see it at the upper right. The name Saiph is from the Arabic saif al jabbar, 'Ø_ÛŒÙÅ Ø§Ù„Ø¬Ø¨Ù‘Ø§Ø±' literally sword of the giant. This name was originally applied to Eta Orionis.In the 17th century catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Rekbah al Jauza al Yemeniat, which was translated into Latin as Genu Dextrum Gigantis ""right knee of the giant"".Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of 650 light-years (198 parsecs) from Earth, which is about the same as Betelgeuse. However, despite being a hotter star, it is smaller and less luminous than Rigel with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.1. The luminosity of this star changes slightly, varying by 0.04 magnitudes.Saiph has a stellar classification of B0.5 Ia. The luminosity class 'Ia' represents a bright supergiant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. Saiph has a strong stellar wind and is losing mass at the rate of 9.0 Ã— 10âˆ’7 times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 1.1 million years. Using a combination of parallax as determined by HIPPARCOS and spectrum yields a mass 15.50 Â± 1.25 times and luminosity 56,881 times that of the Sun. Analysis of the spectra and age of the members of the Orion OB1 association yields a mass 28 times that of the Sun (from an original mass 31.8 times that of the Sun) and an age of 6.2 million years. Large stars such as Saiph (and many other stars in Orion) are destined to collapse on themselves and explode as Type II supernovae."
Heka or Meissa,Heka,"Meissa (Lambda Orionis, Î» Ori) is a star in the constellation Orion. ""Meissa"" derives from the Arabic ""Al-Maisan"" which means ""The Shining One"". This term was used for Gamma Gemini (Alhena), but was somehow also mistakenly applied to Meissa and the name stuck. The original Arabic name for this star, ""Al Hakah"" (the source for another name for it, ""Heka"") refers to the Arabic lunar mansion that includes this star and the two of Ï† Ori (Al Haá¸_Ê_ah, ""a White Spot"").In Chinese, è§œå®¿ (ZÄ« SÃ_), meaning Turtle Beak (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Meissa and both of Ï† Ori Consequently, Meissa itself is known as è§œå®¿ä¸€ (ZÄ« SÃ_ yÄ«, English: the First Star of Turtle Beak.)Meissa is a giant star with a stellar classification of O8 III and an apparent visible magnitude 3.54. It is an enormous star with about 28 times the mass of the Sun and 10 times the Sun's radius. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of around 35,000 K, giving it the characteristic blue glow of a hot O-type star. Meissa is a soft X-ray source with a luminosity of 1032 erg sâˆ’1 and peak emission in the energy range of 0.2â€“0.3 keV, which suggests the X-rays are probably being generated by the stellar wind.This star is the dominant member of a 5-million-year-old star-forming region known as the Î»-Orionis cluster, or Collinder 69. The intense ultraviolet energy being radiated by this star is creating the Sh2-264 H II region in the neighboring volume of space, which in turn is surrounded by an expanding ring of cool gas that has an age of about 2â€“6 million years. The expansion of this gaseous ring may be explained by a former binary companion of Meissa that became a Type II supernova. Such an event would also explain the star's peculiar velocity with respect to the center of the expanding ring, as the explosion and resulting mass loss could have kicked Meissa out of the system. A potential candidate for the supernova remnant is the neutron star Geminga. However, the last is unlikely given the distance between Geminga and the cluster.Meissa is actually a double star with a companion at an angular separation of 4.41 arcseconds along a position angle of 43.12Â° (as of 1937). This fainter component is of magnitude 5.61 and it has a stellar classification of B0.5 V, making it a B-type main sequence star. There is an outlying component, Meissa C, which is an F-type main sequence star with a classification of F8 V. This star in turn may have a very low mass companion that is probably a brown dwarf."
The peacock star,The peacock star,"Alpha Pavonis (Î± Pav) is a star in the southern constellation Pavo, near the shared border with the Telescopium constellation. It is also known by the name Peacock, which was assigned by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s during the creation of the Air Almanac, a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty-seven stars included in the new almanac, two had no classical names: Epsilon Carinae and Alpha Pavonis. The RAF insisted that all of the stars must have names, so new names were invented. Alpha Pavonis was named ""Peacock"" ('pavo' is Latin for 'peacock') whilst Epsilon Carinae was called ""Avior"".At an apparent magnitude of 1.94, this is the brightest star in Pavo. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is about 179 light-years (55 parsecs) distant from the Earth. It has an estimated six times the Sun's mass and 5â€“6 times the Sun's radius, but 2,200 times the luminosity of the Sun. However, Tetzlaff et al. (2011) suggest a much higher mass of 9 times the mass of the Sun. The effective temperature of the photosphere is 18,000 K, which gives the star a blue-white hue. A stellar classification of B2 IV suggests it is a subgiant star that has begun to evolve from the main sequence with the exhaustion of the hydrogen at its core.Stars with the mass of Alpha Pavonis are believed not to have a convection zone near their surface. Hence the material found in the outer atmosphere is not processed by the nuclear fusion occurring at the core. This means that the surface abundance of elements should be representative of the material out of which it originally formed. In particular, the surface abundance of deuterium should not change during the star's main sequence lifetime. The measured ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in this star amounts to less than 5 Ã— 10âˆ’6, which suggests this star may have formed in a region with an unusually low abundance of deuterium, or else the deuterium was consumed by some means. A possible scenario for the latter is that the deuterium was burned through while Alpha Pavonis was a pre-main-sequence star.Alpha Pavonis is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a pair of stars that orbit around each other with a period of 11.753 days. However, in part because the two stars have not been individually resolved, little is known about the companion. The system may be a member of the Tucana-Horologium association of stars that share a common motion through space. The estimated age of this association is 30 million years, which, as the members share a common origin, suggests a similar age for Alpha Pavonis. However, Tetzlaff et al. (2011) suggest an age for this star of only 200,000 years. This star has a peculiar velocity of 13 km sâˆ’1 relative to its neighbors."
Markab or Marchab,Markab,"This article is about the star named Markab, for alternative meanings, see Markab (disambiguation).Alpha Pegasi (Î± Peg, Î± Pegasi) is the third brightest star in the constellation Pegasus and one of the four stars in the asterism known as the Great Square of Pegasus. It has the traditional name Markab (or Marchab), which comes from an Arabic word Ù…Ø±ÙƒØ¨ markab, ""the saddle of the horse"", or is mistranscription of Mankib comes from an Arabic phrase Ù…Ù†ÙƒØ¨ Ø§Ù„ÙÅØ±Ø_ Mankib al-Faras, ""(the Star of) the Shoulder (of the Constellation) of the Horse"" for Î_ Pegasi.Markab has a stellar classification of B9 III, indicating that it is a B-type giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has evolved beyond the main sequence. It is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 125 km/s giving a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity along the star's equator. The effective temperature of the photosphere is nearly 10,000 K and the star has expanded to nearly five times the radius of the Sun."
Scheat,Scheat,"Beta Pegasi (Î_ Peg, Î_ Pegasi) is a red giant star in the constellation Pegasus. The apparent visual magnitude of this star averages 2.42, making it the second brightest star in the constellation after Epsilon Pegasi. Its traditional name is Scheat, a name that has also been used for Delta Aquarii. According to Richard H. Allen, this name comes from the Arabic Al SÄÅ'id for ""the upper arm"", or from Sa'd. Arabian astronomers named it Mankib al Faras, meaning the ""Horse's shoulder"". It forms the upper right corner of the Great Square of Pegasus, a prominent rectangular asterism.Based upon parallax measurements, Beta Pegasi is located about 196 light-years (60 parsecs) from the Earth. It is unusual among bright stars in having a relatively cool surface temperature compared to stars like the Sun. This star has a stellar classification of M2.3 IIâ€“III, which indicates the spectrum has characteristics partway between a bright giant and a giant star. It has expanded until it is some 95 times as large, and has a total luminosity of 1500 times that of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 3,700 K, giving the star the characteristic orange-red hue of an M-type star. The photosphere is sufficiently cool for molecules of titanium oxide to form.Beta Pegasi is a semi-regular variable with a period of 43.3 days and a brightness that varies from magnitude +2.31 to +2.74. It is losing mass at a rate at or below 10âˆ’8 times the Sun's mass per year, which is creating an expanding shell of gas and dust with a radius of about 3,500 times the Sun's radius (16 Astronomical Units)."
Algenib,Algenib,"Alpha Persei (Alpha Per, Î± Persei, Î± Per) is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Perseus, just outshining the constellation's best known star, Algol. Known by the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, it is a circumpolar star when viewed from the latitude of New York City or higher. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, placing it among the brightest stars in the sky. Mirfak lies in the midst of a cluster of stars eponymously named the Alpha Persei Cluster, or Melotte 20, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. The distance to this star has been determined using the parallax technique, putting it 510 light-years (160 parsecs) away."
Enif,Enif,"Epsilon Pegasi (Îµ Peg, Îµ Pegasi) is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Pegasus. It has the traditional name Enif (EE-nif). The name Enif is derived from the Arabic word for nose, due to its position as the muzzle of Pegasus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.4, this is a second-magnitude star that is readily visible to the naked eye. The distance to this star can be estimated using parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, yielding a value of around 690 light-years (210 parsecs).Other traditional names for the star include Fom al Feras, Latinised to Os Equi. In Chinese, åç±å®¿ (WÄ“i SÃ_), meaning Rooftop (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Îµ Pegasi, Î± Aquarii and Î¸ Peg.

Sadalbari,Sadalbari,"Mu Pegasi (Î_ Peg, Î_ Pegasi) is a star in the northern constellation of Pegasus. It has the traditional name Sadalbari, which derives from the Arabic term for ""luck star of the splendid one"". The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 3.5, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye even on a moonlit night. The distance to this star can be determined with parallax measurements, which yields a value of 106.1 light-years (32.5 parsecs).The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G8 III. The luminosity class of 'III' means that it has exhausted the hydrogen fuel at its core and evolved into a giant star. It is slightly more massive than the Sun, but has expanded to nearly ten times the Sun's radius. (Mishenina et al. (2006) list it with an estimated 2.7 times the mass of the Sun.) The effective temperature of the outer atmosphere is about 4,950 K, which is cooler than the Sun and gives it the yellow hue of a G-type star. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is similar to the abundance in the Sun."

Algol,Algol,"Algol (Beta Per, Î_ Persei, Î_ Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright star in the constellation Perseus. It is one of the best known eclipsing binaries, the first such star to be discovered, and also one of the first (non-nova) variable stars to be discovered. Algol is actually a three-star system (Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab) in which the large and bright primary Î_ Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer Î_ Persei Aa2. Thus, Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days (2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes) during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse (the ""second minimum"") when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically. Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as Algol variables."

Al Niyat,Al Niyat,"Tau Scorpii is a star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. It has the traditional name Alniyat or Al Niyat, which it shares with Ïƒ Scorpii. The name derives from the Arabic Ø§Ù„Ù†Ù_Ø§Ø· an-niyÄÅÅ£ meaning ""the arteries"". The apparent visual magnitude of Tau Scorpii is +2.8, while parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of roughly 470 light-years (150 parsecs) from Earth.Compared to the Sun, Tau Scorpii is a massive OB star with 15 times the Sun's mass and more than six times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating about 18,000 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 31,440 K. This gives it the blue-white hue characteristic of B-type stars. As yet there is no evidence of a companion in orbit around Ï„ Sco. It is a magnetic star whose surface magnetic field was mapped by means of Zeemanâ€“Doppler imaging. Tau Scorpii is rotating relatively slowly with a period of 41 days.The spectrum of this star shows triply ionized oxygen (O IV) that is being generated by X-rays and the Auger ionization effect. Observations with the ROSAT space telescope showed it has a higher energy (harder) X-ray spectrum than is usual for B0 V stars. Over the energy range 0.8â€“1.2 keV, its X-ray luminosity is Lx = 1.8 Ã— 1031 erg sâˆ’1 with a large Lx to Lbol of log Lx/Lbol = â€“6.53 from ASCA measurements. ROSAT measurements showed a log Lx/Lbol â‰ƒ â€“5.93 for the range 0.1-2.4 keV.

It is a spectroscopic binary, whose component stars have magnitudes of +4.6 and +6.1. They are separated by 0.012 arcseconds and complete one orbit every 1313 days. They have an 8th magnitude companion, Taygeta B, 69 arcseconds away."
Pleione,Pleione,"Pleione (28 Tauri, BU Tauri) is a binary star in the Pleiades star cluster (M45), located roughly 390 light years away in the constellation of Taurus. Pleione was not given a Bayer designation, but did receive a Flamsteed numberâ€”hence its designation 28 Tauri. Since the star is located close to Atlas, it's difficult for stargazers to distinguish with the naked eye, even though it's a hot type B star 190 times more luminous than the Sun. Pleione rotates even faster than Achernar on its axis, close to its breakup velocity.The brighter star of the binary pair, component A, is a classical Be star with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other. Although some research on the system has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known. Pleione is the seventh brightest star in the Pleiades, after Taygeta."
Celaeno,Celaeno,"Celaeno (Celeno or 16 Tauri) is a star in the constellation Taurus and a member of the Pleiades open cluster of stars. Celaeno has been called the ""Lost Pleiad"" by Theon the Younger.16 Tauri is a blue-white B-type subgiant with an apparent magnitude of +5.45. It is approximately 430 light years from Earth; about the same distance as the Pleiades. The interstellar extinction of this star is fairly small at 0.05 magnitudes. The projected rotational velocity of the equator is 185 km/s. It is over four times the radius of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 12,800 K."
Asterope,Asterope,"The name Asterope or Sterope is shared by two stars, 21 Tauri and 22 Tauri, in the constellation Taurus. They are separated by 0.047Â° on the sky and are both members of the Pleiades open cluster and approximately 440 light years from Earth."
Mothallah or Caput Trianguli,Mothallah,"Alpha Trianguli (Alpha Tri, Î± Trianguli, Î± Tri) is the Bayer designation for a binary star in the constellation Triangulum. It has the traditional names Ras al Muthallah (or Mothallah) and Caput Trianguli.Estimates of the combined stellar classification for this system range from F5III to F6IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' or 'III' indicating the primary component is a subgiant or giant star, respectively. It is a member of a close binary systemâ€”a spectroscopic binaryâ€”whose components complete an orbit about their center of mass once every 1.736 days. Because the primary star is rotating rapidly, it has assumed the shape of an oblate spheroid. The ellipsoidal profile of the star, as viewed from Earth, varies over the course of an orbit causing the luminosity to vary in magnitude during the same period. Such stars are termed ellipsoidal variables. Within a few million years, as the primary continues to evolve into a red giant star, the system may become a semi-detached binary with the Roche lobe becoming filled to overflowing.The mean apparent magnitude of +3.42 for this pair is bright enough to be readily seen with the naked eye. It forms the second brightest star or star system in this generally faint constellation, following Beta Trianguli. Parallax measurements place this system at a distance of 63.3 light-years (19.4 parsecs) from the Earth. The effective temperature of the primary's outer envelope is 6,288 K, giving it a yellow-white hue typical of F-type stars. It has a mean radius about three times the radius of the Sun. The system is an estimated 1.6 billion years old."

Merak or Mirak,Merak,"Beta Ursae Majoris (Beta UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has the traditional name Merak.The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.37, which means it is readily visible to the naked eye. It is more familiar to northern hemisphere observers as one of the ""pointer stars"" in the Big Dipper, or ""The Plough"" in England, which is a prominent asterism of seven stars that forms part of the larger constellation. Extending an imaginary straight line from this star through the nearby Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe) extends to Polaris, the north star."
Phad or Phecda,Phad,"Gamma Ursae Majoris (Gamma UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major. It has the traditional name Phad, or Phecda. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Based upon parallax measurements with the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it is located at distance of around 83.2 light-years (25.5 parsecs).It is more familiar to most observers in the northern hemisphere as the lower-left star forming the bowl of the Big Dipper, together with Dubhe (upper-right), Merak (lower-right) and Megrez (upper-left). Along with four other stars in this well-known asterism, Phecda forms an actual loose, association of stars known as the Ursa Major moving group. Like the other stars in the group, it is a main sequence star not unlike our Sun, although somewhat hotter, brighter and larger.Gamma Ursae Majoris is an Ae star, which is surrounded by an envelope of gas that is adding emission lines to the spectrum of the star; hence the 'e' suffix in the stellar classification of A0 Ve. It has 2.6 times the mass of the Sun, three times the Sun's radius, and an effective temperature of 9,355 K in its outer atmosphere. This star is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 178 km sâˆ’1. The estimated angular diameter of this star is about 0.92 mas. It has an estimated age of 300 million years.Phecda is located in relatively close physical proximity to the prominent Mizar-Alcor star system. The two are separated by an estimated distance of 8.55 ly (2.62 pc); much closer than the two are from the Sun. The star Beta Ursae Majoris is separated from Gamma UMa by 11.0 ly (3.4 pc)."
Megrez,Megrez,"Delta Ursae Majoris (Delta UMa, Î´ Ursae Majoris, Î´ UMa) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has the traditional names Megrez /ËˆmÉ›É¡rÉ›z/, and Kaffa. Megrez has an apparent magnitude of +3.3, making it the dimmest of the seven stars in the Big Dipper asterism. Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of 58.4 light-years (17.9 parsecs) from Earth.Megrez has 63% more mass of the Sun and is about 1.4 times the Sun's radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star.This star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poyntingâ€“Robertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward.It has two faint companions, a 10th magnitude star and an 11th magnitude star, both at an angular separation of two arcminutes from the primary.Megrez is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud. The space velocity components of Delta Ursae Majoris in the galactic coordinate system are [U, V, W] = [+15.35, +1.17, â€“11.52] km sâˆ’1."
Alioth,Alioth,"Epsilon Ursae Majoris (Epsilon UMa, Îµ Ursae Majoris, Îµ UMa) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation being merely ""epsilon""), and at magnitude 1.76 is the thirty-first brightest star in the sky. It has the traditional name Alioth. It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the Big Dipper (Plough) closest to the bowl. It is also a member of the large and diffuse Ursa Major moving group. Historically, the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 navigational stars."
Mizar,Mizar,"Mizar and Alcor form a naked eye double star in the handle of the Big Dipper asterism in the constellation Ursa Major. Mizar is itself a quadruple system and Alcor is a binary, the pair together forming a sextuple system."

It has the traditional names Alkaid (or Elkeid from the Arabic Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø§Ù_Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø§Ø_Ø¯), and Benetnash (Benetnasch). Alkaid is the most eastern (leftmost) star in the Big Dipper (Plough) asterism. However, unlike most stars of the Big Dipper, it is not a member of the Ursa Major moving group. With an apparent visual magnitude of +1.84, it is the third brightest star in the constellation and one of the brightest stars in the night sky.This is a 10-million-year-old B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B3 V. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It has six times the mass of the Sun and 3.4 times the Sun's radius. Eta Ursae Majoris is radiating around 1,350 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of about 16,823 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. This star is an X-ray emitter with a luminosity of 9.3 Ã— 1028 erg sâˆ’1."
Al Haud,Al Haud,"Theta Ursae Majoris (Theta UMa, Î¸ Ursae Majoris, Î¸ UMa) is a suspected spectroscopic binary star system in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.17, placing it among the brighter members of this constellation. The distance to this star has been measured directly using the parallax method, yielding an estimated value of 43.96 light-years (13.48 parsecs).In 1976, this was reported as a spectroscopic binary system by Helmut A. Abt and Saul G. Levy, giving it an orbital period of 371 days. This has been listed as a spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 371 days. However, this was brought into question by Christopher L. Morbey and Roger F. Griffin in 1987, who suggested that the data could be explained by random chance. Further observations in 2009 with observations with the Bok Telescope in Arizona did show changes of 180 m/s in radial velocity, although there was not sufficient evidence to support a Keplerian orbit. There is a 14th-magnitude common proper motion companion to Theta Ursae Majoris at an angular separation of 4.1 arcseconds, so this may potentially be a triple star system.The primary component of this putative system has a published stellar classification of F6 IV, indicating it is a subgiant star that is evolving away from the main sequence. In 2009, Helmut A. Abt listed it with a stellar classification of F7 V, suggesting that it is still on the main sequence. It is larger than the Sun with 141% of the Sun's mass and 250% of the Sun's radius. Consequently it is shining brighter and evolving more rapidly than the Sun, with a luminosity nearly eight times the Sun's at an age of 2.2 billion years. This energy is being radiated from the star's outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,300 K. At this heat, the star glows with the yellow-white hue of an F-type star.The McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the hypothetical presence of one or more planets around the primary with masses between 0.24 and 4.6 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 AU."
Talitha Borealis or Dnoces,Talitha B,"Iota Ursae Majoris (Iota UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a star system in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.14, making it visible to the naked eye and placing it among the brighter members of this constellation. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of 47.3 light-years (14.5 parsecs) from Earth. It has the traditional names Talitha, Talitha Borealis and Alphikra Borealis, and was also dubbed Dnoces (""Second,"" backwards) after Edward H. White II, an Apollo 1 astronaut. The name was invented by his fellow astronaut Gus Grissom as a practical joke.The Iota Ursae Majoris system is composed of two binary stars. The brightest component is a white A-type subgiant. It is a spectroscopic binary whose components have an orbital period of 4028 days. The companion binary is composed of the 9th magnitude and 10th magnitude stars. These two stars orbit around each other with a period of 39.7 years, and are separated by roughly 0.7 arcseconds, or at least 10 AU. This pair may be the source of the X-ray emission detected from this system.The two binary systems orbit around each other once every 818 years. The apparent separation between the two binaries is rapidly decreasing as they follow their orbits. In 1841 when the B component was first discovered, they had a separation of 10.7 arcseconds, or at least 156 AU. By 1971 their separation had decreased to 4.5 arcseconds, or at least 66 AU. This system appears to be dynamically unstable with a high likelihood and may become disrupted on a time scale on the order of 105 years."
Talitha Australis,Talitha Australis,"Kappa Ursae Majoris (Kappa UMa, Îº Ursae Majoris, Îº UMa) is a binary star in the constellation Ursa Major. It is approximately 358 light years from Earth and has the traditional names Talitha Australis, Al Kaprah, and Alphikra Australis.Both components of the binary star are a white A-type main sequence dwarfs. They have apparent magnitudes of +4.2 and +4.5, which gives the system a combined apparent magnitude of +3.60. The orbital period of the binary is 35.6 years (13,007.2 days), and the two stars are separated by 0.18 arcseconds."
Tania Australis,Tania Australis,"Mu Ursae Majoris (Mu UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major. An apparent visual magnitude of +3.06 places it among the brighter members of the constellation. Parallax measurements give an estimated distance of roughly 230 light-years (71 parsecs) from Earth, with a margin of error of 4%. This star has the proper name Tania Australis (formerly Tania australis)Mu Ursae Majoris is an evolved star that is currently in the red giant stage with a stellar classification of M0 IIIab. It has expanded to 75 times the radius of the Sun whilst the outer atmosphere has cooled to an effective temperature of 3,899 K, giving it the orange-red hued glow of an M-type star. Estimates of the luminosity range from 977â€“1,200 times that of the Sun. It is classified as a semiregular variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude 2.99m to 3.33m.This is a spectroscopic binary star system with a companion a mere 0.2 AU from the primary, assuming a distance of 71 parsecs, with an orbital period of 230 days."
Alula Borealis,Alula B,"Nu Ursae Majoris (Nu UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a double star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major.

Based upon parallax measurements, the distance to Î_ Ursae Majoris is about 399 light-years (122 parsecs).This is a giant star with a stellar classification of K3 III. It has expanded to about 57 times the radius of the Sun and is radiating 775 times the Sun's luminosity. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 4,070 K; cool enough to give it an orange hue typical of a K-type star. It has a 10th-magnitude optical companion at an angular separation of 7.1 arcseconds."
Alula Australis,Alula Australis,"Xi Ursae Majoris (Xi UMa, Î_ Ursae Majoris, Î_ UMa) is a star system in the constellation Ursa Major. On May 2, 1780, Sir William Herschel discovered that this was a binary star system, making it the first such system ever discovered. It was the first visual double star for which an orbit was calculated, when it was computed by FÃ©lix Savary in 1828.The two components are yellow G-type main-sequence stars. The brighter component, Xi Ursae Majoris A, has a mean apparent magnitude of +4.41. It is classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.01 magnitudes. The companion star, Xi Ursae Majoris B has an apparent magnitude of +4.87. The orbital period of the two stars is 59.84 years, and they are currently separated by 1.2 arcseconds, or at least 10 AU.Each component of this double star is itself a spectroscopic binary. B's binary companion, denoted Xi Ursae Majoris Bb, is unresolved, but the binary star is known to have an orbital period of 3.98 days. The masses of both A and B's companions (Ab and Bb) (deduced by the sum total mass of the system minus the likely masses of Aa and Ba determined by their class) indicate that they are probably MV stars (red dwarfs), Bb being on the cool end of the M spectrum, not much hotter than a brown dwarf.It also has the proper name Alula Australis (and erroneously Alula Australe)."
Muscida,Muscida,"4 Ursae Majoris (sometimes abbreviated 4 Uma) is the Flamsteed designation of a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It also bears the Bayer designation of PiÂ_ Ursae Majoris (PiÂ_ UMa, Ï€Â_ Ursae Majoris, Ï€Â_ UMa) and is traditionally named Muscida. With an apparent visual magnitude of +4.6, this star is visible from suburban or darker skies based upon the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale. From parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this star is at a distance of 256 light-years (78 parsecs) from Earth. As of 2011, one extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the star."
Polaris,Polaris,"Polaris (Î± Ursae Minoris, Î± UMi, commonly the North Star or Pole Star) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.Polaris is a multiple star, comprising the main star, Î± UMi Aa, which is a supergiant; two smaller companions, Î± UMi B and Î± UMi Ab; and two distant components, Î± UMi C and Î± UMi D.

Kochab or Kokab,Kochab,"Beta Ursae Minoris (Î_ UMi, Î_ Ursae Minoris) is the brightest star in the bowl of the ""Little Dipper"" (which is part of the constellation Ursa Minor), and only slightly fainter than Polaris, the northern pole star and brightest star in Ursa Minor. It has the traditional name Kochab. Kochab is 16 degrees from Polaris and has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.08. The distance to this star can be deduced from the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos, yielding a value of 130.9 light-years (40.1 parsecs).Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad served as twin pole stars, circling the North Pole, from 1500 BC until 500 AD. Ancient Egyptian astronomers referred to them as ""The Indestructibles"". Neither star was as proximitous to the celestial north pole as Polaris is now. Today, they are sometimes referred to as the ""Guardians of the Pole."" Due to precession of the equinoxes, the previous holder of the title was Thuban, and the next was the present-day Polaris. This succession of pole stars is a result of Earth's precessional motion.Amateur astronomers can use Kochab as a very precise guide for setting up a telescope, as the celestial north pole is located 43 arcminutes away from Polaris, very close to the line connecting Polaris with Kochab."

Vindemiatrix,Vindemiatrix,"Epsilon Virginis (Îµ Vir, Îµ Virginis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. It has the traditional name Vindemiatrix, which comes from Greek through Latin and means Grape Gatherer. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.8, making it the third brightest member of Virgo. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, Vindemiatrix lies at a distance of about 109.6 light-years (33.6 parsecs) from Earth, give or take a half light year.Vindemiatrix is a giant star with a stellar classification of G8 III. With 2.6 times the mass of the Sun, it has reached a stage in its evolution where the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted. As a result, it has expanded to over ten times the Sun's girth and is now radiating around 77 times as much luminosity as the Sun. This energy is being emitted from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,086 K, which gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star.

Zaniah,Zaniah,"Eta Virginis (Î· Vir, Î· Virginis) is a multiple star system in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. It has the traditional name Zaniah /zÉ™ËˆnaÉª.É™/. From parallax measurements, the distance to this star was found to be roughly 265 light-years (81 parsecs). It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.89, which is bright enough for the system to be seen with the naked eye in dark skies.Although the star looks single, lunar occultations have shown this star to be a very close triple star system consisting of two stars only 0.6 AU apart, assuming a distance of 91 parsecs, with a third slightly more distant star. The inner pair is a spectroscopic binary that completes an orbit with a period of 72 days. The inclination of this orbit was determined through interferometer observations to be 45.5Â°, which allowed the individual masses of the two stars to be estimated. The primary star, Î· Vir Aa, has a mass of about 2.5 times the Sun's mass, while the secondary, Î· Vir Ab, has 1.9 solar masses. The faint tertiary star, Î· Vir B, orbits the inner group in a wider orbit over a period of 13.1 years.Because Zaniah is near the ecliptic, it can be occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. On October 12, 272 BC, the ancient Greek astronomer Timocharis observed a conjunction of the star with Venus. The last occultation by a planet took place on September 27, 1843, also by Venus, which will occult it again on November 19, 2445."
