Original Name,Wiki Name,Summary
Alpheratz,Alpheratz,"Alpha Andromedae (Alpha And, α And, α Andromedae), which has the traditional names Alpheratz (or Alpherat from the Arabic word الفرس) and Sirrah (or Sirah), is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda. Located immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus, it is the northeastern star of the Great Square of Pegasus. Ptolemy considered Alpha Andromedae to be shared by Pegasus, and Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations: Alpha Andromedae (α And) and Delta Pegasi (δ Peg). When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the latter designation dropped from use.
It is located 97 light-years from Earth. Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star, with overall apparent visual magnitude +2.06, it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit. The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury-manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury, manganese, and other elements, including gallium and xenon. It is the brightest mercury-manganese star known."
Caph,Caph,"Beta Cassiopeiae (β Cas, β Cassiopeiae) is a Delta Scuti variable star in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is a subgiant or giant star belonging to the spectral class F2. The white star of second magnitude (+2.27 mag) has an absolute magnitude of +1.16 mag. It has the traditional name Caph, from the Arabic word كف kaf, ""palm"" (i.e. reaching from the Pleiades)."
Algenib,Algenib,"Alpha Persei (Alpha Per, α Persei, α Per) is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Perseus, just outshining the constellation's best known star, Algol. Known by the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, it is a circumpolar star when viewed from the latitude of New York City or higher. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, placing it among the brightest stars in the sky. Mirfak lies in the midst of a cluster of stars eponymously named the Alpha Persei Cluster, or Melotte 20, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. The distance to this star has been determined using the parallax technique, putting it 510 light-years (160 parsecs) away."
Ankaa,Ankaa,"Alpha Phoenicis (α Phe, α Phoenicis), or Ankaa, is the brightest star in the constellation Phoenix."
Shedir,Shedir,"Alpha Cassiopeiae (α Cas, α Cassiopeiae) is a second magnitude star in the constellation Cassiopeia, with the traditional name Schedar, sometimes spelled Shedir. Though listed as the ""alpha star"" by Johann Bayer, α Cas's visual brightness closely rivals the beta star in the constellation (Beta Cassiopeiae, also known as Caph) and it may appear marginally brighter or dimmer, depending on which passband is used. However, recent calculations from NASA's WISE telescope confirm that α Cas is the brightest in Cassiopeia, with a apparent magnitude of 2.240. Its absolute magnitude is 18 times greater than β Cas, although it is located farther away from Earth (228 light years versus 54)."
Diphda,Diphda,"Beta Ceti (β Cet, β Ceti) is the brightest star in the constellation Cetus. Although it has the Bayer designation ""beta"", it is actually brighter than Alpha Ceti. It has the traditional names Deneb Kaitos and Diphda. This orange giant is easy to identify due to its location in an otherwise dark section of the celestial sphere. Based on parallax measurements, it lies at an estimated distance of 96.3 light-years (29.5 parsecs) from Earth."
96 G. Psc,96 G. Psc,"This is the list of notable stars in the constellation Pisces, sorted by decreasing brightness."
Mirach,Mirach,"Beta Andromedae (Beta And, β And, β Andromedae) is the Bayer designation for a prominent star in the northern constellation of Andromeda. It has the traditional name Mirach, which is also spelled Merach, Mirac, Mirak. β Andromedae is located northeast of the Great Square of Pegasus and is theoretically visible to all observers north of 54° S. The galaxy NGC 404, also known as Mirach's Ghost, is visible seven arc-minutes away.
This star has an average apparent visual magnitude of 2.05, which makes it the brightest star in the constellation. However, the luminosity varies slightly from magnitude +2.01 to +2.10. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly 197 light-years (60 parsecs) from Earth. The apparent magnitude of this star is reduced by 0.06 from extinction caused by the gas and dust along the line of sight."
Ruchbah,Ruchbah,"The traditional star name Rucbah can refer to three different stars:
Alpha Aquarii in the Aquarius constellation
Delta Cassiopeiae in the Cassiopeia constellation
Alpha Sagittarii in the Sagittarius constellation (Al Rami, Rukbat)
Alpha Sagittarii in fiction, namely Rukbat, is the sun in Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, from 1967"
Achernar,Achernar,"Achernar /ˈeɪkərnɑːr/ (α Eri, α Eridani, Alpha Eridani), sometimes spelled Achenar, is the brightest star in the constellation Eridanus and the tenth-brightest star in the night sky. Of the ten apparent brightest stars in the nighttime sky, Achernar is the hottest and bluest in color, being of spectral type B. Lying at the southern tip of Eridanus, the star has an unusually rapid rotational velocity, causing it to become oblate in shape. Achernar is actually a binary star system, with the second star known as Achernar B. The second star is smaller and orbits Achernar A at a distance of roughly 12 astronomical units (AU). Achernar B is of spectral type A."
Sheratan,Sheratan,"Beta Arietis (β Ari, β Arietis) is a binary star system in the constellation Aries, marking the Ram's second horn."
Almaak,Almaak,"Gamma Andromedae (Gamma And, γ And, γ Andromedae) is the third brightest point of light in the constellation of Andromeda. It is also known by the traditional name Almach (also spelt as Almaach, Almaack, Almak, Almaak, or Alamak).
In 1778, Johann Tobias Mayer discovered that γ Andromedae was a double star. When examined in a small telescope, it appears to be a bright, golden yellow star (γ1 Andromedae) next to a dimmer, indigo blue star (γ2 Andromedae), separated by approximately 10 arcseconds. It is often considered by stargazers to be a beautiful double star with a striking contrast of color. It was later discovered that γ2 Andromedae is itself a triple star system. What appears as a single star to the naked eye is thus a quadruple star system, approximately 350 light-years from the Earth."
Hamal,Hamal,"Hamal (α Ari, α Arietis, Alpha Arietis) is the brightest star in the northern zodiacal constellation of Aries. It has the Bayer designation α Arietis and the Flamsteed designation of 13 Arietis. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.0, it is among the brightest stars in the night sky. Based upon parallax measurements made with Hipparcos astrometry satellite, Hamal is about 65.8 light-years (20.2 parsecs) from Earth. It is a giant star that may host an orbiting planet with a mass greater than Jupiter."
Polaris,Polaris,"Polaris (α Ursae Minoris, α UMi, commonly the North Star or Pole Star) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.
Polaris is a multiple star, comprising the main star, α UMi Aa, which is a supergiant; two smaller companions, α UMi B and α UMi Ab; and two distant components, α UMi C and α UMi D. α UMi B was discovered in 1780 by William Herschel."
268 G. Cet,268 G. Cet,"This is the list of notable stars in the constellation Cetus, sorted by decreasing brightness."
Acamar,Acamar,"Theta Eridani (θ Eri, θ Eridani) is a star in the constellation Eridanus. It has the traditional name Acamar from the Arabic آخِر النَّهْر Ākhir an-nahr which means ""the end of the river"". Historically, Acamar represented the end of the constellation Eridanus. Now that distinction is held by the star Achernar, a star which shares the same Arabic etymology. Achernar is not visible from the Greek isles (latitudes > 33° North), hence the choice of Acamar as the river's end during the time of Hipparchus and later Ptolemy.
The term Ākhir an-nahr or Achr al Nahr was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as Postrema Fluminis.
In Chinese, 天園 (Tiān Yuán), meaning Celestial Orchard, refers to an asterism consisting of θ Eridani, χ Eridani, φ Eridani, κ Eridani, HD 16754, HD 23319, HD 24072, HD 24160, υ4 Eridani, 43 Eridani, υ2 Eridani and υ1 Eridani. Consequently, θ Eridani itself is known as 天園六 (Tiān Yuán liù, English: the Sixth Star of Celestial Orchard.)
Acamar is a double star with some evidence suggesting it is part of a multiple star system. The main star, θ1 Eri, is of the spectral class A4 and has a +3.2 apparent magnitude. Its companion star, θ2 Eri, is of the spectral class A1 and has an apparent magnitude of +4.3. The angular separation of the two stars is equal to 8.3 arcseconds. Acamar's distance from Earth as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite is approximately 120 light-years.
Ptolemy described Acamar as a first-magnitude star, which some have taken to be in fact Achernar, which today appears just above the horizon in Alexandria where Ptolemy lived.
Achernar, however, was not visible to Ptolemy (it is from Alexandria today due to precession); its declination in 100CE was -67, making it invisible even at Aswan. Ptolemy's Eridanus thus without doubt ended at Acamar, which rose about 10 degrees above the horizon from Alexandria. This fact besides positively identifying Acamar as the original ""end of the river"", also strengthens the case for Acamar having been first magnitude in ancient times."
Menkar,Menkar,"Alpha Ceti (α Cet, α Ceti) is a star in the constellation of Cetus. It has the traditional name Menkar or Menkab. The name Menkar derives from the Arabic word منخر manħar ""nostril"" (of Cetus).
This star, along with γ Cet (Kaffaljidhma), δ Cet, λ Cet (Menkar), μ Cet, ξ1 Cet and ξ2 Cet were Al Kaff al Jidhmah, ""the Part of a Hand"".
In Chinese, 天囷 (Tiān Qūn), meaning Circular Celestial Granary, refers to an asterism consisting of α Ceti, κ1 Ceti, λ Ceti, μ Ceti, ξ1 Ceti, ξ2 Ceti, ν Ceti, γ Ceti, δ Ceti, 75 Ceti, 70 Ceti, 63 Ceti and 66 Ceti. Consequently, α Ceti itself is known as 天囷一 (Tiān Qūn yī, English: the First Star of Circular Celestial Granary.)"
Algol,Algol,"Algol (Beta Per, β Persei, β Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright star in the constellation Perseus. It is one of the best known eclipsing binaries, the first such star to be discovered, and also one of the first (non-nova) variable stars to be discovered. Algol is actually a three-star system (Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab) in which the large and bright primary β Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer β Persei Aa2. Thus, Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days (2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes) during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse (the ""second minimum"") when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically. Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as Algol variables."
82 G. Eri,82 G. Eri,"Barnard's Star /ˈbɑːrnərd/ is a very-low-mass red dwarf about six light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It is the fourth-closest known individual star to the Sun (after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system) and the closest star in the Northern Hemisphere. Despite its proximity, at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine, it is not visible with the unaided eye; however, it is much brighter in the infrared than it is in visible light.
The star is named for American astronomer E. E. Barnard. He was not the first to observe the star (it appeared on Harvard University plates in 1888 and 1890), but in 1916 he measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year, which remains the largest known proper motion of any star relative to the Solar System.
Barnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, it still experiences star flare events, one being observed in 1998.
The star has also been the subject of some controversy. For a decade, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s, Peter van de Kamp claimed that there were one or more gas giants in orbit around it. Although the presence of small terrestrial planets around Barnard's Star remains a possibility, Van de Kamp's specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s.

Mirphak,Mirphak,"Alpha Persei (Alpha Per, α Persei, α Per) is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Perseus, just outshining the constellation's best known star, Algol. Known by the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, it is a circumpolar star when viewed from the latitude of New York City or higher. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, placing it among the brightest stars in the sky. Mirfak lies in the midst of a cluster of stars eponymously named the Alpha Persei Cluster, or Melotte 20, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. The distance to this star has been determined using the parallax technique, putting it 510 light-years (160 parsecs) away."
Alcyone,Alcyone,"Alcyone (η Tau, η Tauri, Eta Tauri) is a star system in the constellation Taurus. It is the brightest star in the Pleiades open cluster, which is a young cluster, aged at around 100 million years. Alcyone is approximately 440 light years from Earth. It is named after the mythological figure Alcyone, one of the mythological Pleiades. It is known as 昴宿六 (the Sixth Star of the Hairy Head) in Chinese."
Zaurak,Zaurak,"Gamma Eridani (γ Eri, γ Eridani) is a star in the constellation Eridanus. It has the traditional name Zaurak, which means ""the boat.""
In Chinese, 天苑 (Tiān Yuàn), meaning Celestial Meadows, refers to an asterism consisting of γ Eridani, δ Eridani, π Eridani, ε Eridani, ζ Eridani, η Eridani, π Ceti, τ1 Eridani, τ2 Eridani, τ3 Eridani, τ4 Eridani, τ5 Eridani, τ6 Eridani, τ7 Eridani, τ8 Eridani and τ9 Eridani. Consequently, γ Eridani itself is known as 天苑一 (Tiān Yuàn yī, English: the First Star of Celestial Meadows.)"
Aldebaran,Aldebaran,"Aldebaran (α Tau, α Tauri, Alpha Tauri) is an orange giant star located about 65 light years away. It is the brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus. It varies slowly in brightness between magnitude 0.75 and 0.95, which means it is usually the fourteenth brightest star in the nighttime sky. The name Aldebaran is Arabic (الدبران al-dabarān) and means ""the Follower"", presumably because it rises near and soon after the Pleiades. It is likely that Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the size of Jupiter.
The planetary exploration probe Pioneer 10 is currently heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years."
Hassaleh,Hassaleh,"Iota Aurigae (ι Aur, ι Aurigae) is a star in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the traditional name Al Kab, short for Kabdhilinan, from the Arabic الكعب ذي العنان al-kacb ðīl-cinān ""the shoulder of the rein holder (charioteer)"". Under the name Alkab, this star is a marker on the astrolabe described by Geoffrey Chaucer in his Treatise on the Astrolabe in 1391. In Antonín Bečvář's atlas it has the traditional name Hassaleh. It is known as 五車一 (the First Star of the Five Chariots) in Chinese.
This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.7, which is bright enough to be readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements give a distance estimate of roughly 490 light-years (150 parsecs) from the Earth. At this distance, extinction from interstellar dust is causing a magnitude reduction of about 0.6. Examination of the spectrum yields a stellar classification of K3 II, with the luminosity class of 'II' indicating this is a category of evolved star known as a bright giant. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 4,160 K, which is cooler than the Sun's effective temperature and gives Iota Aurigae the orange hue of a K-type star.
This star is a weak X-ray emitter with an X-ray luminosity of about 1.8 × 1027 ergs s−1. This emission is most likely coming from transient loops of plasma in Iota Aurigae's outer atmosphere, which have a temperature of around 3 million K. This is a suspected variable star, although this variability remains unconfirmed."
Cursa,Cursa,"Beta Eridani (Beta Eri, β Eridani, β Eri) is the second brightest star in the constellation of Eridanus, located in the northeast end of this constellation near the shared border with Orion. It has the traditional name Cursa. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.796, so it can be viewed with the naked eye in dark skies. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of about 89 light-years (27 parsecs) from the Earth."
Rigel,Rigel,"Rigel, also known by its Bayer designation Beta Orionis (β Ori, β Orionis), is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the night sky, with visual magnitude 0.13. The star as seen from Earth is actually a triple or quadruple star system, with the primary star (Rigel A) a blue-white supergiant that is estimated to be anywhere from 120,000 to 279,000 times as luminous as the Sun, depending on method used to calculate its properties. It has exhausted its core hydrogen and swollen out to between 79 and 115 times the Sun's radius. It pulsates quasi-periodically and is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable. A companion, Rigel B, is 500 times fainter than the supergiant Rigel A and visible only with a telescope. Rigel B is itself a spectroscopic binary system, consisting of two main sequence blue-white stars of spectral type B9V that are estimated to be respectively 3.9 and 2.9 times as massive as the Sun. Rigel B also appears to have a very close visual companion Rigel C of almost identical appearance."
Capella,Capella,"Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth brightest in the night sky and the third brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega. Its name is derived from the diminutive of the Latin feminine capra ""goat"", hence ""little she goat"". Capella also bears the Bayer designation Alpha Aurigae (often abbreviated to α Aurigae, α Aur or Alpha Aur). Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, type-G giant stars, designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 AU apart and a derived orbital period of 104 days.
Capella Aa is the brighter of the two at spectral class G8III (G8 Giant) whereas Ab is slightly smaller and of spectral class G0III (G0 Giant). Aa has a calculated mass of 3.05 times that of the Sun and Ab some 2.57 times that of the Sun. These two stars have both exhausted their core hydrogen fuel and become giant stars, though it is unclear exactly what stage they are on the stellar evolutionary pathway. The second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. They are designated Capella H and Capella L. The stars labelled Capella C through to G and I through to K are actually unrelated stars in the same visual field. The Capella system is relatively close, at only 42.8 light-years (13.1 pc) from Earth."
Bellatrix,Bellatrix,"Bellatrix, also known by its Bayer designation Gamma Orionis (γ Ori, γ Orionis), is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion, 5° right of the red giant α Ori (Betelgeuse). Just between the 1st and 2nd magnitude, it is the 27th brightest star in the night sky."
Alnath,Alnath,"Beta Tauri (β Tau, β Tauri) is the second brightest star in the constellation Taurus, with an apparent magnitude of 1.68. Ptolemy considered Beta Tauri to be shared by Auriga, and Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations: Beta Tauri (β Tau) and Gamma Aurigae (γ Aur). When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the latter designation dropped from use. The star has the traditional name Elnath—a reference to ""the butting"" of the bull's horns."
Mintaka,Mintaka,"Mintaka is a star some 1,200 light years distant in the constellation Orion. It has a Bayer designation of Delta Orionis (δ Ori) and a Flamsteed designation of 34 Orionis. The name Mintaka comes from منطقة manṭaqa, which means ""the belt"" in Arabic. Together with Alnitak (Zeta Orionis) and Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis), the three stars make up the belt of Orion, known by many names among ancient cultures. When Orion is close to the meridian, Mintaka is the right-most of the belt's stars as seen by an observer in the Northern Hemisphere facing south."
Arneb,Arneb,"Alpha Leporis (α Lep, α Leporis) is the brightest star in the constellation Lepus. It has the traditional name Arneb, from the Arabic أرنب ’arnab ""hare"".
This is a massive star with about 14 times the mass of the Sun. The interferometer-measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is 1.77 ± 0.09 mas. At an estimated distance of 2,218 light-years (680 parsecs), this yields a physical size of about 129 times the radius of the Sun. Alpha Leporis has a stellar classification of F0 Ib, with the Ib luminosity class indicating that it is a lower luminosity supergiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is about 6,850 K, which gives the star a yellow-white hue that is typical of F-type stars. It is an estimated 13 million years old.
Alpha Leporis is an older, dying star that may have already passed through a supergiant phase and is now contracting and heating up in the latter phases of stellar evolution, or perhaps is still expanding into the supergiant phase. Based upon its estimated mass, it is expected to end its life in a spectacular stellar explosion known as a supernova."
Hatsya,Hatsya,"Iota Orionis (ι Ori, ι Orionis) is a star in the equatorial constellation of Orion the hunter. The apparent visual magnitude of Iota Orionis is 2.77, making it the eighth brightest member of Orion.
Iota Orionis is the brightest star in an asterism known as Orion's sword. It has the traditional names Hatsya or Hatysa and in Arabic, Na’ir al Saif, which means simply ""the Bright One of the Sword."" From parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly 1,330 light-years (410 parsecs) from Earth.
Iota Orionis is a quadruple system dominated by a massive spectroscopic binary with an eccentric (e=0.764), 29-day orbit. The two components of ι Ori A are a stellar class O9 III star (blue giant) and a class B0.8 III/IV star about 2 magnitudes fainter. The collision of the stellar winds from this pair makes the system a strong X-ray source. Oddly, the two objects of this system appear to have different ages, with the secondary being about double the age of the primary. In combination with the high eccentricity of their orbit, this suggests that the binary system was created through a capture, rather than by being formed together and undergoing a mass transfer. This capture may have occurred, for example, through an encounter between two binary systems.
ι Ori has a B8 giant companion at 11"" (approximately 5,000 AU) which has been shown to be variable, and likely to be a young stellar object. There is also a fainter A0 star at 49"" catalogued as ι Ori C."
Alnilam,Alnilam,"Alnilam is a large blue supergiant star some 1,340 light years distant in the constellation of Orion. It has a Bayer designation of Epsilon Orionis (ε Ori) and its Flamsteed designation is 46 Orionis. It is estimated to be 275,000 to 537,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and around 34 times as massive."
Phakt,Phakt,"Alpha Columbae (α Columbae, α Col) is the Bayer designation for a third magnitude star in the southern constellation of Columba. It has the traditional name of Phact, which is derived from the Arabic term for ""ring-necked dove"". It has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.6, making it the brightest member of Columba. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, Alpha Columbae is located at a distance of around 261 light-years (80 parsecs)."
Alnitak,Alnitak,"Alnitak (Arabic: النطاق an-niṭāq‎) is a multiple star several hundred parsecs away in the constellation Orion. It is part of Orion's Belt along with Alnilam and Mintaka, and has a Bayer designation of Zeta Orionis (ζ Ori) and a Flamsteed designation of 50 Orionis.
The primary star is a hot blue supergiant with an absolute magnitude of -6.0 and is the brightest class O star in the night sky with a visual magnitude of +2.0. It has two bluish 4th magnitude companions, one finely resolved and one only detected interferometrically and spectroscopically, producing a combined magnitude for the trio of +1.77. The stars are members of the Orion OB1 association and the Collinder 70 association."
Saiph,Saiph,"Saiph (κ Orionis, 53 Orionis) is the sixth-brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Of the four bright stars that compose Orion's main quadrangle, it is the star at the south-eastern corner. A northern-hemisphere observer facing south would see it at the lower left of Orion, and a southern-hemisphere observer facing north would see it at the upper right. The name Saiph is from the Arabic saif al jabbar, 'سیف الجبّار' literally sword of the giant. This name was originally applied to Eta Orionis.
In the 17th century catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Rekbah al Jauza al Yemeniat, which was translated into Latin as Genu Dextrum Gigantis ""right knee of the giant"".
Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of 650 light-years (198 parsecs) from Earth, which is about the same as Betelgeuse. However, despite being a hotter star, it is smaller and less luminous than Rigel with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.1. The luminosity of this star changes slightly, varying by 0.04 magnitudes.
Saiph has a stellar classification of B0.5 Ia. The luminosity class 'Ia' represents a bright supergiant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. Saiph has a strong stellar wind and is losing mass at the rate of 9.0 × 10−7 times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 1.1 million years. Using a combination of parallax as determined by HIPPARCOS and spectrum yields a mass 15.50 ± 1.25 times and luminosity 56,881 times that of the Sun. Analysis of the spectra and age of the members of the Orion OB1 association yields a mass 28 times that of the Sun (from an original mass 31.8 times that of the Sun) and an age of 6.2 million years. Large stars such as Saiph (and many other stars in Orion) are destined to collapse on themselves and explode as Type II supernovae."
Betelgeuse,Betelgeuse,"Betelgeuse, also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Orionis (shortened to α Orionis or α Ori), is the ninth-brightest star in the night sky and second-brightest in the constellation of Orion. Distinctly reddish, it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.0 and 1.3, the widest range of any first-magnitude star. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle, and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon. The star's name is derived from the Arabic إبط الجوزاء Ibt al-Jauzā' or يد الجوزاء Yad al-Jauzā', meaning ""the hand of Orion"".
The star is classified as a red supergiant of spectral type M1-2 and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained, but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun. Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light-years, yielding a mean absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this crimson runaway has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova within the next million years. An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.
In 1920, Betelgeuse became the second star (after the Sun) to have the angular size of its photosphere measured. Since then, researchers have used telescopes with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant, often with conflicting results. Studies since 1990 have produced an angular diameter (apparent size) ranging from 0.043 to 0.056 arcseconds, an incongruity largely caused by the star's tendency to periodically change shape. Due to limb darkening, variability, and angular diameters that vary with wavelength, many of the star's properties are not yet known with any certainty. Adding to these challenges, the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex, asymmetric envelope roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by colossal mass loss."
Menkalinan,Menkalinan,"Beta Aurigae (β Aur, β Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the traditional name Menkalinan, which is shortened from the Arabic منكب ذي العنان mankib ðī-l-‘inān ""shoulder of the rein-holder"". It is known as 五車三 (the Third Star of the Five Chariots) in traditional Chinese astronomy. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the system is 1.9, making it the second brightest member of the constellation after Capella. Using the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, the distance to this star system can be estimated as 81.1 light-years (24.9 parsecs), give or take a half light year margin of error."
Mirzam,Mirzam,"Beta Canis Majoris (β CMa, β Canis Majoris) is a star in the southern constellation of Canis Major, the 'greater dog', and is located at a distance of about 500 light-years (150 parsecs) from the Earth. In the modern constellation it lies at the position of the dog's head. It has the traditional name Murzim, Al-Murzim or Mirzam, which is derived from the Arabic (مرزم) for 'The Herald', and probably refers to its position, heralding Sirius in the night sky (i.e., rising before it).
In Chinese, 軍市 (Jūn Shì), meaning Market for Soldiers, refers to an asterism consisting of β Canis Majoris, ν3 Canis Majoris, 15 Canis Majoris, π Canis Majoris, ο1 Canis Majoris and ξ1 Canis Majoris. Consequently, β Canis Majoris itself is known as 軍市一 (Jūn Shì yī, English: the First Star of Market for Soldiers). From this Chinese name arose the name Kuen She.
The Dunhuang Star Chart noted β Canis Majoris as Yeji ""Pheasant Cock"", though was located about 10 degrees too far north of its correct position.

Canopus,Canopus,"Canopus (/kəˈnoʊpəs/; α Car, α Carinae, Alpha Carinae) is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina, and the second brightest star in the night-time sky, after Sirius. Canopus's visual magnitude is −0.72, and it has an absolute magnitude of −5.65.
Canopus is a supergiant of spectral type F. Canopus is essentially white when seen with the naked eye (although F-type stars are sometimes listed as ""yellowish-white""). It is located in the far southern sky, at a declination of −52° 42' (2000) and a right ascension of 06h24.0m.
Its name comes from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta."
Alhena,Alhena,"Gamma Geminorum (γ Gem, γ Geminorum) is the third brightest star in the constellation Gemini. It has the traditional names Alhena and Almeisan. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.9, making it easily visible to the naked eye even in urban regions. Based upon parallax measurements with the Hipparcos satellite, it is located at a distance of roughly 109 light-years (33 parsecs) from Earth."
Sirius,Sirius,"Sirius (/ˈsɪriəs/) is the brightest star (in fact, a star system) in the Earth's night sky. With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The name ""Sirius"" is derived from the Ancient Greek Σείριος (Seirios), meaning ""glowing"" or ""scorcher"". The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.
Sirius appears bright because of both its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbors. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's sky for the next 210,000 years.
Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun (M☉) and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.
Sirius is also known colloquially as the ""Dog Star"", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Greater Dog). The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the ""dog days"" of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians in the Southern Hemisphere the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean."
Adhara,Adhara,"Epsilon Canis Majoris (ε CMa, ε Canis Majoris) is the second brightest star in the constellation Canis Major, and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation ""epsilon"" despite being the second brightest and not the fifth brightest star in its constellation. It has the traditional name Adhara (sometimes spelled Adara). The name is from the Arabic word عذارى ‘aðāra’, ""virgins"". It was once the brightest star in the sky, with an apparent magnitude of -3.99.
In Chinese, 弧矢 (Hú Shǐ), meaning Bow and Arrow, refers to an asterism consisting of ε Canis Majoris, δ Canis Majoris, η Canis Majoris, HD 63032, HD 65456, ο Puppis, k Puppis, κ Canis Majoris and π Puppis. Consequently, ε Canis Majoris itself is known as 弧矢七 (Hú Shǐ qī, English: the Seventh Star of Bow and Arrow.)
In the 17th century catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Aoul al Adzari (أول ألعذاري - awwil al-aðārii), which was translated into Latin as Prima Virginum, meaning First of the Virgins. Along with δ CMa (Wezen), η CMa (Aludra) and ο2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), these stars were Al ʽAdhārā (ألعذاري), the Virgins."
Wezen,Wezen,"Delta Canis Majoris (δ CMa, δ Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major. It has the traditional name Wezen, Wesen, or Wezea. It is a yellow-white F-type supergiant with an apparent magnitude of +1.83. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified."
Aludra,Aludra,"Eta Canis Majoris (η CMa, η Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major. It has the traditional name Aludra. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
The name Aludra originates from the Arabic: عذرا al-‘aðrā ""the virgin"". This star, along with ε CMa (Adhara), δ CMa (Wezen) and ο2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), were Al ʽAdhārā (ألعذاري), the Virgins.
In Chinese, 弧矢 (Hú Shǐ), meaning Bow and Arrow, refers to an asterism consisting of η Canis Majoris, δ Canis Majoris, HD 63032, HD 65456, ο Puppis, k Puppis, ε Canis Majoris, κ Canis Majoris and π Puppis. Consequently, η Canis Majoris itself is known as 弧矢二 (Hú Shǐ èr, English: the Second Star of Bow and Arrow.)"
Gomeisa,Gomeisa,"Beta Canis Minoris (β CMi, β Canis Minoris) is a star in the constellation of Canis Minor. In the night sky it is notable for its proximity to the prominent star Procyon. It has the traditional name Gomeisa, which comes from the Arabic al-ghumaisa’ ""the bleary-eyed (woman)"", short for مرزم الغميصاء mirzam al-ghumaisa’ ""girdle of the bleary-eyed one"". In Arabic, the short form would be identical with the name of Procyon.
In Chinese, 南河 (Nán Hé), meaning South River, refers to an asterism consisting of β Canis Minoris, Procyon and ε Canis Minoris. Consequently, β Canis Minoris itself is known as 南河二 (Nán Hé èr, English: the Second Star of South River.)"
Procyon,Procyon,"Canis Minor /ˌkeɪnᵻs ˈmaɪnər/ is a small constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and it is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for ""lesser dog"", in contrast to Canis Major, the ""greater dog""; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter.
Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, as well as one of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December."
Pollux,Pollux,"USNS Pollux (T-AK-290), later T-AKR-290, the fourth United States Navy ship of the name, is an Algol-class vehicle cargo ship that is currently maintained by the United States Maritime Administration as part of the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) as SS Pollux (T-AKR-290).
In keeping with the pattern of the naming the Algol-class ships after bright stars, the Pollux was named after Pollux, a star in the northern constellation of Gemini.

"
Naos,Naos,"USS Naos (AK-105) was laid down as SS William R. Nelson under Maritime Commission contract by California Shipbuilding Corp., Los Angeles, California, 8 June 1943, named after Naos, the star in constellation Puppis. Naos was launched 30 June 1943 and sponsored by Miss Barbara Quarg. The ship was delivered to the Navy under bareboat charter 15 July 1943, converted for Navy use by Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, San Pedro, California, and commissioned at San Pedro 17 August 1943,as a Crater-class cargo ship with Lieutenant Commander N. E. Wilcox in command."
Miaplacidus,Miaplacidus,"Beta Carinae (β Car, β Carinae) is the second brightest star in the constellation Carina and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, with apparent magnitude 1.68. It is the brightest star in the south polar asterism known as the Diamond Cross, marking the southwestern end of the asterism. Beta Carinae also has the traditional name Miaplacidus, meaning ""placid waters"". It lies near the planetary nebula IC 2448. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of 113.2 light-years (34.7 parsecs) from Earth.
Beta Carinae's traditional name Miaplacidus made its debut on star maps in 1856 when the star atlas Geography of the Heavens, composed by Elijah Hinsdale Burritt, was published. The meaning and linguistic origin of the name remained an enigma for many decades, until William Higgins, a great scholar and expert on star names, surmised that the name Miaplacidus is apparently a bilingual combination of Arabic مياه miyāh for ""waters"" and Latin placidus for ""placid"".
In Chinese, 南船 (Nán Chuán), meaning Southern Boat, refers to an asterism consisting of β Carinae, V337 Carinae, PP Carinae, θ Carinae and ω Carinae . Consequently, β Carinae itself is known as 南船五 (Nán Chuán wǔ, English: the Fifth Star of Southern Boat.)
The stellar classification of A1 III– suggests this is an evolved giant star, although Malagnini and Morossi (1990) rated it as an A2 IV subgiant star. It has an estimated age of 260 million years. This star does not show an excess emission of infrared radiation that might otherwise suggest the presence of a debris disk. It has about 3.5 times the Sun's mass and has expanded to almost seven times the radius of the Sun. Presently is it radiating 288 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 8,866 K. Despite its enlarged girth, this star still shows a rapid rotation rate, with a projected rotational velocity of 146 km s−1."
Alphard,Alphard,"Alphard (α Hya, α Hydrae, Alpha Hydrae) is the brightest star in the constellation Hydra. The name Alphard is from the Arabic الفرد (al-fard), ""the solitary one"", there being no other bright stars near it. It was also known as the ""backbone of the Serpent"" to the Arabs. In ancient China it formed part of an asterism called the ""red bird"". The European astronomer Tycho Brahe dubbed it Cor Hydræ, the heart of the snake.
In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, it was designated Soheil al Fard, which was translated into Latin as Soheil Solitarius, meaning the bright solitary one.
In Chinese, 星宿 (Xīng Xiù), meaning Star, refers to an asterism consisting of Alphard, τ1 Hydrae, τ2 Hydrae, ι Hydrae, 26 Hydrae, 27 Hydrae, HD 82477 and HD 82428. Consequently, Alphard itself is known as 星宿一 (Xīng Xiù yī), ""the First Star of Star""."
Ras Elased Australis,Ras Elased Australis,"Epsilon Leonis (ε Leo, ε Leonis) is the fifth brightest star in the constellation Leo, consistent with its Bayer designation Epsilon. The star has the traditional names Ras Elased (Australis), Asad Australis and Algenubi, all of which derive from the Arabic رأس الأسد الجنوبي rās al-’asad al-janūbī, which means ""the southern (star) of the lion's head""; australis is Latin for ""southern""."
Regulus,Regulus,"Regulus (α Leo, α Leonis, Alpha Leonis) is the brightest star in the constellation Leo and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, lying approximately 79 light years from Earth. Regulus is a multiple star system composed of four stars that are organized into two pairs. The spectroscopic binary Regulus A consists of a blue-white main-sequence star and its companion, which has not yet been directly observed, but is probably a white dwarf. Located farther away is the pair Regulus B and Regulus C and D, which are dim main-sequence stars."
Algieba,Algieba,"Gamma Leonis (γ Leo, γ Leonis) is a binary star system in the constellation Leo. It has the traditional name Algieba or Al Gieba."
Merak,Merak,"Beta Ursae Majoris (Beta UMa, β Ursae Majoris, β UMa) is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has the traditional name Merak.
The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.37, which means it is readily visible to the naked eye. It is more familiar to northern hemisphere observers as one of the ""pointer stars"" in the Big Dipper, or ""The Plough"" in England, which is a prominent asterism of seven stars that forms part of the larger constellation. Extending an imaginary straight line from this star through the nearby Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe) extends to Polaris, the north star."
Dubhe,Dubhe,"Alpha Ursae Majoris (Alpha UMa, α Ursae Majoris, α UMa) is the second-brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation of ""alpha""). It has the traditional name Dubhe, and a rarer name Ak."
Zosma,Zosma,"Delta Leonis (δ Leo, δ Leonis) is a star in the zodiac constellation of Leo. It has the traditional names Zosma (or Zozma) and Duhr. Rare spellings include Zozca, Zosca, Zubra, and Dhur. The name Zosma means girdle in ancient Greek, referring to the star's location in its constellation, on the hip of the lion. Based upon parallax measurements, it lies at a distance of about 58.4 light-years (17.9 parsecs) from the Earth."
Denebola,Denebola,"Denebola (β Leo, β Leonis, Beta Leonis) is the third brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Leo. It is an A-type main sequence star with 75% more mass than the Sun and fifteen times the Sun's luminosity. Based on parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the star is at a distance of about 36 light-years (11 parsecs) from Earth. Its apparent visual magnitude is 2.14, making it readily visible to the naked eye. Denebola is a suspected Delta Scuti type variable star, meaning its luminosity varies very slightly over a period of a few hours."
Phad,Phad,"Gamma Ursae Majoris (Gamma UMa, γ Ursae Majoris, γ UMa) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major. It has the traditional name Phad, or Phecda. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Based upon parallax measurements with the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it is located at distance of around 83.2 light-years (25.5 parsecs).
It is more familiar to most observers in the northern hemisphere as the lower-left star forming the bowl of the Big Dipper, together with Dubhe (upper-right), Merak (lower-right) and Megrez (upper-left). Along with four other stars in this well-known asterism, Phecda forms an actual loose, association of stars known as the Ursa Major moving group. Like the other stars in the group, it is a main sequence star not unlike our Sun, although somewhat hotter, brighter and larger.
Gamma Ursae Majoris is an Ae star, which is surrounded by an envelope of gas that is adding emission lines to the spectrum of the star; hence the 'e' suffix in the stellar classification of A0 Ve. It has 2.6 times the mass of the Sun, three times the Sun's radius, and an effective temperature of 9,355 K in its outer atmosphere. This star is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 178 km s−1. The estimated angular diameter of this star is about 0.92 mas. It has an estimated age of 300 million years.
Phecda is located in relatively close physical proximity to the prominent Mizar-Alcor star system. The two are separated by an estimated distance of 8.55 ly (2.62 pc); much closer than the two are from the Sun. The star Beta Ursae Majoris is separated from Gamma UMa by 11.0 ly (3.4 pc)."
Megrez,Megrez,"Delta Ursae Majoris (Delta UMa, δ Ursae Majoris, δ UMa) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has the traditional names Megrez /ˈmɛɡrɛz/, and Kaffa. Megrez has an apparent magnitude of +3.3, making it the dimmest of the seven stars in the Big Dipper asterism. Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of 58.4 light-years (17.9 parsecs) from Earth.
Megrez has 63% more mass of the Sun and is about 1.4 times the Sun's radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star.
This star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poynting–Robertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward.
It has two faint companions, a 10th magnitude star and an 11th magnitude star, both at an angular separation of two arcminutes from the primary.
Megrez is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud. The space velocity components of Delta Ursae Majoris in the galactic coordinate system are [U, V, W] = [+15.35, +1.17, –11.52] km s−1."
Gienah Ghurab,Gienah Ghurab,"Gamma Corvi (γ Crv, γ Corvi) is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Corvus, having an apparent visual magnitude of 2.6. Its traditional name is Gienah, which it shares with Epsilon Cygni. The name ""Gienah Corvi"", or ""Gienah Ghurab"", may be used to distinguish it from this star in Cygnus. The distance to this star has been measured directly using the parallax technique, yielding an estimated 154 light-years (47 parsecs) from Earth."
Acrux,Acrux,"Alpha Crucis (α Cru, α Crucis, also Acrux, HD 108248) is the brightest star in the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, and, at a combined visual magnitude 0.77, is the 13th brightest star in the night sky. Acrux is the southernmost first-magnitude star, just a little more southerly than Alpha Centauri."
Gacrux,Gacrux,"Gamma Crucis (γ Cru, γ Crucis), often called Gacrux, is the nearest red giant star to the Sun. The distance to Gacrux has been determined using parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, which yielded a value of 88.6 light-years (27.2 parsecs) away from Earth. With an apparent visual magnitude of +1.63, this is the third-brightest star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross, and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Among Portuguese-speaking peoples it is also named ""Rubídea"" (or Ruby-like), in reference to its color. A line from the two ""Pointers"", Alpha Centauri through Beta Centauri, leads to within a few degrees of this star."
Becrux,Becrux,"Beta Crucis, also known as Mimosa or Becrux, is the second brightest star in the constellation Crux (after Alpha Crucis or Acrux) and is the 19th brightest star in the night sky. It forms part of the prominent asterism called the Southern Cross, which appears on five national flags. Although Beta Crucis, ""Becrux"", is at roughly −60° declination, and therefore not visible north of 30°, in the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans it was visible north of 40° due to the precession of equinoxes, and these civilizations regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus. Its modern name, Mimosa, which is derived from the Latin word for ""actor"", may come from the flower of the same name."
Alioth,Alioth,"Epsilon Ursae Majoris (Epsilon UMa, ε Ursae Majoris, ε UMa) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation being merely ""epsilon""), and at magnitude 1.76 is the thirty-first brightest star in the sky. It has the traditional name Alioth. It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the Big Dipper (Plough) closest to the bowl. It is also a member of the large and diffuse Ursa Major moving group. Historically, the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 navigational stars."
Cor Caroli,Caroli,"USS Cor Caroli (AK-91) was an Crater-class cargo ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy for service in World War II, named after Cor Caroli, the brightest star in constellation Canes Venatici. She was responsible for delivering goods and equipment to locations in the war zone.
Cor Caroli (AK-91) was launched 19 March 1943 as SS Betsy Ross by Permanente Metals Corp., Yard No. 2, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. F. Modglin; acquired by the Navy 31 March 1943; commissioned 16 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander J. A. Lewis, USCGR, in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet."
Vindemiatrix,Vindemiatrix,"Epsilon Virginis (ε Vir, ε Virginis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. It has the traditional name Vindemiatrix, which comes from Greek through Latin and means Grape Gatherer. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.8, making it the third brightest member of Virgo. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, Vindemiatrix lies at a distance of about 109.6 light-years (33.6 parsecs) from Earth, give or take a half light year.
Vindemiatrix is a giant star with a stellar classification of G8 III. With 2.6 times the mass of the Sun, it has reached a stage in its evolution where the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted. As a result, it has expanded to over ten times the Sun's girth and is now radiating around 77 times as much luminosity as the Sun. This energy is being emitted from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,086 K, which gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
This star is a likely member of the thin disk population and the orbit departs by no more than 60 pc (200 ly) from the galactic plane."
Mizar,Mizar,"Mizar and Alcor form a naked eye double star in the handle of the Big Dipper asterism in the constellation Ursa Major. Mizar is itself a quadruple system and Alcor is a binary, the pair together forming a sextuple system."
Spica,Spica,"Spica (/ˈspaɪkə/; α Vir, α Virginis, Alpha Virginis) is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, and the 15th brightest star in the night sky. Located 250 ± 10 light years from Earth, it is actually a spectroscopic binary and rotating ellipsoidal variable—a system whose two main stars are so close together they are egg-shaped rather than spherical, and can only be separated by their spectrum. The primary is a blue giant and a variable star of the Beta Cephei type."
Alkaid,Alkaid,"Eta Ursae Majoris (Eta UMa, η Ursae Majoris, η UMa) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major. It has the traditional names Alkaid (or Elkeid from the Arabic القايد القائد), and Benetnash (Benetnasch). Alkaid is the most eastern (leftmost) star in the Big Dipper (Plough) asterism. However, unlike most stars of the Big Dipper, it is not a member of the Ursa Major moving group. With an apparent visual magnitude of +1.84, it is the third brightest star in the constellation and one of the brightest stars in the night sky.
This is a 10-million-year-old B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B3 V. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It has six times the mass of the Sun and 3.4 times the Sun's radius. Eta Ursae Majoris is radiating around 1,350 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of about 16,823 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. This star is an X-ray emitter with a luminosity of 9.3 × 1028 erg s−1."
Mufrid,Mufrid,"Eta Boötis (η Boo, η Boötis) is a star in the constellation Boötes. It has the traditional names Muphrid and Saak, and the Flamsteed designation 8 Boötis. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
The name Muphrid is from the Arabic مفرد الرامح mufrid ar-rāmiħ ""the (single) one of the lancer"". In Chinese, 右攝提 (Yòu Niè Dī), meaning ""the Right Conductor"", refers to an asterism consisting of Eta Boötis, Tau Boötis and Upsilon Boötis. Consequently, Eta Boötis itself is known as 右攝提一 (Yòu Niè Dī yī, English: ""the First Star of the Right Conductor""). In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Ramih al Ramih (رمح الرامح—rumḥ al rāmiḥ), which was translated into Latin as Lancea Lanceator, possibly meaning the lance of the lancer.
This star is a subgiant that has begun the process of evolving from a main sequence star into a red giant. It has about 1.7 times the mass of the Sun and 2.7 times the Sun's radius. The estimated age of this star is about 2.7 billion years. Based on its spectra, Eta Boötis has a significant excess of elements heavier than helium. In fact the ratio of iron to hydrogen is considered close to the upper limit for dwarf stars in the galactic disk. The star is a suspected spectroscopic binary with a reported period of 494 days, but the companion was not confirmed through speckle interferometry. This measurement does not rule out a low mass stellar companion of spectral class M7.
Eta Boötis appears close to the prominent star Arcturus (Alpha Bootis) in Earth's sky, and Arcturus is in fact its closest stellar neighbor, as both stars are nearly identical in distance from the Sun. The two stars are about 3.24 light years apart, and each would appear bright in the other's sky. Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta Boötis, while Eta Boötis would appear at about magnitude −2.4 (absolute magnitude −2.41 at 0.99 parsec)) in the sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in our night sky."
Thuban,Thuban,"Thuban (Arabic: ثعبان‎, thuʿbān, ""snake""), also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Draconis (α Draconis, α Dra), is a star (or star system) in the constellation of Draco. A relatively inconspicuous star in the night sky of the Northern Hemisphere, it is historically significant as having been the north pole star from the 4th to 2nd millennium BC. It is sometimes known as the Dragon's Tail and as Adib.
Even though Johann Bayer gave Thuban the designation Alpha, its apparent magnitude of 3.65 is 3.7 times fainter than the brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), whose apparent magnitude is 2.24."
Menkent,Menkent,"Theta Centauri (θ Cen, θ Centauri) is a star in the southern constellation of Centaurus, the centaur. It has the traditional Arabic name Menkent (possibly abbreviation of ألمنكب ألقنتوس - al mankib al-qanturis, meaning ""shoulder of the Centaur""). This star has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.06, making it the fourth brightest member of the constellation. This star is close enough to the Earth that its distance can be measured using the parallax technique, yielding a value of 58.8 light-years (18.0 parsecs).
In Chinese, 庫樓 (Kù Lóu), meaning Arsenal, refers to an asterism consisting of θ Centauri, ζ Centauri, η Centauri, 2 Centauri, HD 117440, ξ1 Centauri, γ Centauri, τ Centauri, D Centauri and σ Centauri. Consequently, θ Centauri itself is known as 庫樓三 (Kù Lóu sān, English: the Third Star of Arsenal.)
This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is 5.46 ± 0.06 mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 10.6 times the radius of the Sun. The outer envelope has an effective temperature of 4,980 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a cool, K-type star. Soft X-ray emission has been detected from this star, which has an estimated X-ray luminosity of 1.4 × 1027 erg s−1."
Arcturus,Arcturus,"Arcturus (/ɑːrkˈtjʊərəs/; α Boo, α Boötis, Alpha Boötis) of the constellation Boötes is the brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. With a visual magnitude of −0.05, it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after −1.46 magnitude Sirius, −0.86 magnitude Canopus, and −0.27 magnitude Alpha Centauri. It is a relatively close star at only 36.7 light-years from Earth, and, together with Vega and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.
Arcturus is a type K0 III orange giant star, with an absolute magnitude of −0.30. It has likely exhausted its hydrogen from its core and is now in its active hydrogen shell burning phase. It will continue to expand before entering horizontal branch stage of its life cycle."
Rigil Kentaurus,Rigil Kentaurus,"Alpha Centauri (α Cen), also known as Rigil Kent (/ˈraɪdʒəl ˈkɛnt/) (the ""Centaur's Foot"") or Toliman, is the closest star system to the Solar System at 4.37 ly (1.34 pc). It consists of three stars: the pair Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, Alpha Centauri C, better known as Proxima Centauri, that may be gravitationally bound to the other two. (Beta Centauri, or β Centauri, should not be confused with Alpha Centauri B, and is a separate, trinary, system of its own.)  To the unaided eye, the two main components appear as a single object of an apparent visual magnitude of −0.27, forming the brightest star in the southern constellation Centaurus and the third-brightest star in the night sky, only outshone by Sirius and Canopus.
Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A) has 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B) is smaller and cooler, at 90.7% of the Sun's mass and 44.5% of its visual luminosity. During the pair's 79.91-year orbit about a common center, the distance between them varies from about that between Pluto and the Sun to that between Saturn and the Sun. Proxima is at the slightly smaller distance of 1.29 parsecs or 4.24 light years from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about 0.06 parsecs, 0.2 light years or 15,000 astronomical units (AU), equivalent to 500 times the size of Neptune's orbit."
Izar,Izar,"Epsilon Boötis (ε Boo, ε Boötis) is a double star in the northern constellation of Boötes. It has the traditional name Izar and was named Pulcherrima (most beautiful) by Otto Struve. The star system can be viewed with the unaided eye at night, but resolving the pair with a small telescope is challenging; an aperture of 76 mm (3.0 in) or greater is required."
Kochab,Kochab,"Beta Ursae Minoris (β UMi, β Ursae Minoris) is the brightest star in the bowl of the ""Little Dipper"" (which is part of the constellation Ursa Minor), and only slightly fainter than Polaris, the northern pole star and brightest star in Ursa Minor. It has the traditional name Kochab. Kochab is 16 degrees from Polaris and has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.08. The distance to this star can be deduced from the parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos, yielding a value of 130.9 light-years (40.1 parsecs).
Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad served as twin pole stars, circling the North Pole, from 1500 BC until 500 AD. Ancient Egyptian astronomers referred to them as ""The Indestructibles"". Neither star was as proximitous to the celestial north pole as Polaris is now. Today, they are sometimes referred to as the ""Guardians of the Pole."" Due to precession of the equinoxes, the previous holder of the title was Thuban, and the next was the present-day Polaris. This succession of pole stars is a result of Earth's precessional motion.
Amateur astronomers can use Kochab as a very precise guide for setting up a telescope, as the celestial north pole is located 43 arcminutes away from Polaris, very close to the line connecting Polaris with Kochab."
Zubenelgenubi,Zubenelgenubi,"Alpha Librae (α Lib, α Librae), or Zubenelgenubi, is the second brightest star in the constellation Libra (despite its Bayer designation as alpha). Alpha2 Librae is 0.33 degree from the ecliptic so it can be easily occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. The next occultation by a planet will be by Mercury on 10 November 2052."
Zubeneschemali,Zubeneschemali,"Beta Librae (β Lib, β Librae), or Zubeneschamali, is the brightest star in the zodiac constellation of Libra. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.6. From parallax measurements, its distance can be estimated as 185 light-years (57 parsecs) from Earth."
Alphekka,Alphekka,"Alpha Coronae Borealis (α CrB, α Coronae Borealis, Alphecca) is a binary star in the constellation Corona Borealis. It is located about 75 light years from our Solar System."
Unukalhai,Unukalhai,"Alpha Serpentis (α Serpentis, α Ser) is a double star in the head (Serpens Caput) of the equatorial constellation Serpens. It has the traditional name Unukalhai. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.6, this star is the brightest in the constellation and it can be viewed with the naked eye from most of the Earth. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of about 74 light-years (23 parsecs) from Earth."
Dschubba,Dschubba,"Delta Scorpii (δ Sco, δ Scorpii) is a star in the constellation Scorpius. It has the traditional name Dschubba.
Because it is near the ecliptic δ Scorpii is occasionally occulted by the Moon, or (extremely rarely) by planets. It was once used as a spectroscopic standard for the B0 IV classification, but is now considered too unusual and variable.
Delta Scorpii is a proper motion member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius–Centaurus OB association, the nearest such co-moving association of massive stars to the Sun. The Upper Scorpius subgroup contains thousands of young stars with mean age 11 million years at average distance of 470 light years (145 parsecs)."
Graffias,Graffias,"USS Graffias (AF-29), a Hyades-class stores ship, is the only ship of the United States Navy to have this name. The name Graffias is another name for the star Beta Scorpii in the constellation Scorpius.
The Graffias was originally laid down in 1943 as Topa Topa, a Maritime Commission type (C2-S-E1) hull under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1610) at the Gulf Shipbuilding Company, Chickasaw, Alabama. The ship was acquired by the United States Navy on 19 February 1944 and subsequently converted by the Bethlehem Steel Company, Baltimore, Maryland. The Graffias was commissioned at Baltimore on 28 October 1944, with Lieutenant Commander B. P. Caraher in command."
Antares,Antares,"Antares (/ænˈtɑːriːz/), also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Scorpii (abbreviated to α Scorpii or α Sco), is the fifteenth brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, and is often referred to as ""the heart of the scorpion"". Along with Aldebaran, Regulus, and Fomalhaut, Antares comprises the group known as the 'Royal stars of Persia'. It is one of the four brightest stars near the ecliptic.
Distinctly reddish when viewed with the unaided eye, Antares is a red supergiant of spectral type M0.5Iab and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. It is a slow irregular variable star with the quoted magnitude of +0.96. Antares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association (the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, which contains thousands of stars with mean age 11 million years at a distance of approximately 145 parsecs (470 light years)."
Rasalgethi,Rasalgethi,"Alpha Herculis (α Her, α Herculis) is a multiple star system in the constellation Hercules. It has the traditional name Rasalgethi or Ras Algethi (Arabic: رأس الجاثي ra's al-jaθiyy‎ Head of the Kneeler), and the Flamsteed designation 64 Herculis. The traditional name ""Head"" comes from the fact that in antiquity Hercules was depicted upside down on the constellation maps.
The term ra's al-jaθiyy or Ras al Djathi was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as Caput Ingeniculi.
In Chinese astronomy, Rasalgethi is called 帝座, Pinyin: Dìzuò, meaning Emperor's Seat, this star is marking itself and stands alone in the center of Emperor's Seat asterism, Heavenly Market enclosure (see : Chinese constellations). 帝座 (Dìzuò) was westernized into Ti Tso by R.H. Allen, with the same meaning"
Rastaban,Rastaban,"Beta Draconis (β Draconis, β Dra) is the third brightest star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. It has the traditional name Rastaban, which has also been used for Gamma Draconis. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.79, it is bright enough to be easily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it lies at a distance of about 380 light-years (120 parsecs) from Earth.
Compared to the Sun, this is an enormous star with six times the mass and roughly 40 times the radius. At this size, Beta Draconis is emitting about 950 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 5,160 K, giving it the yellow hue of a G-type star. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G2 Ib–IIa, with the luminosity class notation Ib–IIa indicating it lies part way between the bright giant and giant stages of its stellar evolution. It is about 67 million years old.
This is a binary star system, with a binary star designation of ADS 10611, in which the supergiant is orbited by a dwarf companion once every four millennia or so."
Shaula,Shaula,"Lambda Scorpii (λ Sco, λ Scorpii) is a blue star and the second brightest star system in the constellation Scorpius, and one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky. It has the Bayer designation λ despite being the second brightest in its constellation. It has the traditional name Shaula, which comes from the Arabic الشولاء al-šawlā´ meaning the raised [tail], as it is found in the tail of the scorpion (Scorpius). It is known as Wei Xiu Ba 尾宿八 (the Eighth Star of the Tail) in Chinese."
Rasalhague,Rasalhague,"Alpha Ophiuchi (α Oph, α Ophiuchi) is the brightest star in the constellation Ophiuchus. It has the traditional name Ras Alhague, often condensed to Rasalhague.
Alpha Ophiuchi is a binary star system with an orbital period of about 8.62 years. The orbital parameters were only poorly known until 2011 when observations using adaptive optics produced a better orbital fit, allowing the individual masses of the two components to be determined. The primary component, Alpha Ophiuchi A, has a mass of about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun, while the secondary, Alpha Ophiuchi B, has 0.85 solar masses. Estimates of the mass of the primary by other means range from a low of 1.92 to 2.10 solar masses, up to 2.84 or even 4.8 solar masses. The mass of the secondary suggests that it has a stellar classification in the range K5V to K7V, which indicates it is a main sequence star that is still generating energy by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The pair reached periastron passage, or closest approach, around April 19, 2012, when they had an angular separation of 50 milliarcseconds.
This star system has a combined apparent magnitude of +2.08 and is located at a distance of about 48.6 light-years (14.9 parsecs) from the Earth. The stellar classification of A5 III indicates that the primary is a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence after consuming the hydrogen at its core. It is radiating about 25 times the luminosity of the Sun and has an effective temperature of about 8,000 K, giving it the characteristic white hue of an A-type star.
Alpha Ophiuchi A is a rapidly rotating star with a projected rotational velocity of 240 km s−1. It is spinning at a rate of about 88.5% of the velocity that would cause the star to break up. The resulting equatorial bulge is about 20% larger than the polar radius, giving the star the shape of an oblate spheroid. Because of this distorted shape, the poles have an effective temperature about 1,840 K greater than along the equator. The axis of rotation of the star is inclined about 87.°7 ± 0°4 to the line of sight from the Earth, so that it is being observed from nearly equator-on.
The spectrum of Alpha Ophiuchi shows an anomalously high level of absorption of the lines for singly-ionized calcium (Ca II). However, this is likely the result of interstellar matter between the Earth and the star, rather than a property of the star or circumstellar dust."
Sargas,Sargas,"Theta Scorpii (θ Sco, θ Scorpii) is a star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. It has the traditional name Sargas, of Sumerian origin. In Chinese, it is referred to as 尾宿五 (Mandarin: wěi xiù wǔ), the Fifth Star of the Tail. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +1.87, making it readily visible to the naked eye and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It is sufficiently near that the distance can be measured directly using the parallax technique, which yields an estimate of roughly 300 light years (90 parsecs).
This is an evolved bright giant star with a stellar classification of F0 II. With a mass 5.7 times that of the Sun, it has expanded to about 26 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 1,834 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 7,268, giving it the yellow-white hued glow of an F-type star. This star is rotating rapidly, giving it an oblate shape with an equatorial radius 19% larger than the polar radius.
It has a magnitude 5.36 companion at an angular separation of 6.470 arcseconds.

"
Cebalrai,Cebalrai,"Beta Ophiuchi (β Oph, β Ophiuchi) is a star in the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus. It has the traditional names Celbalrai, which comes from the Arabic كلب الراعي kalb al-rā‘ī meaning ""shepherd dog"". It is also called Cheleb, Kelb Alrai, or sometimes just Alrai. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.7, which is readily visible to the naked eye even from urban skies. The distance to this star can be estimated using parallax measurements, yielding a value of 81.8 light-years (25.1 parsecs).
This is a giant star with a stellar classification of K2 III. Although it is only 13% greater in mass than the Sun, it has reached a stage in its evolution where the atmosphere has expanded to about 12 times the Sun's radius and is radiating 63 times the luminosity of the Sun. Its outer envelope is relatively cool with an effective temperature of 4,467 K, giving it the orange hue typical of K-type stars. Like some other K-type giants, β Ophiuchi has been found to vary very slightly (0.02 magnitudes) in brightness.,
Cebalrai is a member of the thin disk population. It is following a low eccentricity orbit through the Milky Way galaxy that carries it between a distance of 27.3–30.9 kly (8.4–9.5 kpc) from the Galactic Center and up to 0.62 kly (0.19 kpc) above or below the galactic plane."
Etamin,Etamin,"Gamma Draconis (γ Dra, γ Draconis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Draco. It has the traditional name Etamin, Eltanin or Ettanin and the Flamsteed designation 33 Draconis. Despite its gamma designation, it is actually the brightest star in Draco at magnitude 2.4, outshining Rastaban (Beta Draconis) by nearly half a magnitude. Its proximity to the zenith point directly overhead of London has earned it the name ""Zenith Star."" As for other places, it is relatively easy to locate in the night sky. If one finds Vega, Eltanin is the red star just north-northwest of it.
Eltanin lies around 154.3 light-years (47.3 parsecs) away, as determined by parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. In 1728, while unsuccessfully attempting to measure the parallax of this star, James Bradley discovered the aberration of light resulting from the movement of the Earth. Bradley's discovery confirmed Copernicus' theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun."
Kaus Meridionalis,Kaus Meridionalis,"Delta Sagittarii (Delta Sgr, δ Sagittarii, δ Sgr) is a double star in the southern zodiac constellation of Sagittarius. It has the traditional names Kaus Media, Kaus Meridionalis, and Media.The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.70, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements place the distance at roughly 348 light-years (107 parsecs) from Earth.
This is a giant star with a stellar classification K3 III.
It has three dim companions:
a 14th magnitude star at a separation of 26 arcseconds,
a 15th magnitude star at a separation of 40 arcseconds, and
a 13th magnitude star at a separation of 58 arcseconds from the primary.
It is not certain that these stars form a physical system or whether they are merely aligned by chance."
Kaus Australis,Kaus Australis,"Epsilon Sagittarii (Epsilon Sgr, ε Sagittarii, ε Sgr) is a binary star system in the southern zodiac constellation Sagittarius. Its traditional name is Kaus Australis. The apparent visual magnitude of +1.85 makes it the brightest star in the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements, the distance to this star is around 143 light-years (44 parsecs)."
Kaus Borealis,Kaus B,"Delta Sagittarii (Delta Sgr, δ Sagittarii, δ Sgr) is a double star in the southern zodiac constellation of Sagittarius. It has the traditional names Kaus Media, Kaus Meridionalis, and Media.The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.70, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements place the distance at roughly 348 light-years (107 parsecs) from Earth.
This is a giant star with a stellar classification K3 III.
It has three dim companions:

a 15th magnitude star at a separation of 40 arcseconds, and
a 13th magnitude star at a separation of 58 arcseconds from the primary.
It is not certain that these stars form a physical system or whether they are merely aligned by chance."
Vega,Vega,"Vega (α Lyr, α Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae) is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is a relatively close star at only 25 light-years from Earth, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.
Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed ""arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun."" Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.
Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.
Based on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars."
Sheliak,Sheliak,"USS Sheliak (AKA-62) was an Andromeda-class attack cargo ship named after Beta Lyrae, a binary star system in the constellation Lyra. She was one of a handful of AKA's manned by a Coast Guard crew. USS Sheliak served as a commissioned ship for 17 months.
Sheliak (AKA-62) was laid down on 19 June 1944 under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 214) by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, N.J.; launched on 17 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Nellie Blanch Regan; and commissioned on 1 December 1944, Comdr. Searcy J. Lowery, USCG, in command."
Nunki,Nunki,"Sigma Sagittarii (Sigma Sgr, σ Sagittarii, σ Sgr) is the second brightest star in the constellation Sagittarius. Its modern name Nunki is an Assyrian or Babylonian name recovered by archaeologists and made public by R. H. Allen. Nunki has an apparent magnitude of +2.05, making it readily visible to the naked eye. The distance to this star, determined using parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, yields an estimated value of 228 light-years (70 parsecs) from Earth.
Nunki has a spectrum matching a stellar classification of B2.5 V, which indicates this is a B-type main sequence star. The total luminosity of σ Sgr is 3300 times that of the Sun while it has a surface temperature of 18,890 K. X-ray emission has been detected from this star, which has an estimated X-ray luminosity of 1.2 × 1028 erg s−1. Sigma Sgr has a 10th magnitude optical companion located 5.2 arcminutes away.
Because it is close to the ecliptic, Nunki can be occulted by the Moon and very rarely by planets. The last occultation of Nunki by a planet took place on November 17, 1981, when it was occulted by Venus. Furthermore, Nunki is the brightest star that can be principally occulted by an exterior planet between 5000 BC and 5000 AD. However, only Mars can do this, and only rarely; the last time was on September 3, 423."
Albaldah,Albaldah,"Pi Sagittarii (Pi Sgr, π Sagittarii, π Sgr) is a triple star system in the zodiac constellation Sagittarius. It has the traditional name Albaldah.
Albaldah has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.89, which is sufficiently bright to be readily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of roughly 510 light-years (160 parsecs) from Earth. Because it is close to the ecliptic, Albaldah can sometimes be occulted by the Moon, and, very rarely, planets of the Solar System. The next occultation by a planet takes place on February 17, 2035, when it will be occulted by Venus.
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of F2 II. The 'II' luminosity class is for a bright giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has followed an evolutionary track away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. Because it has nearly six times the mass of the Sun, it reached this stage in a mere 67 million years. The outer envelope is radiating energy at an effective temperature of about 6,590 K, giving it the yellow-white hue of an F-type star.
Pi Sagittarii has two nearby companions. The first is located at an angular separation of 0.1 arcseconds from Albaldah, or at least 13 Astronomical Units (AU). The second is 0.4 arcseconds away, which is 40 AU or more. Nothing is known about the orbits of these stars."
Albireo,Albireo,"Albireo (β Cyg, β Cygni, Beta Cyg, Beta Cygni) is the fifth brightest star in the constellation Cygnus. Although it has the Bayer designation beta, it is fainter than Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni. Albireo appears to the naked eye to be a single star of magnitude 3 but through a telescope, even low magnification views resolve it into a double star. The brighter yellow star (actually itself a very close binary system) makes a striking colour contrast with its fainter blue companion star."
Tarazed,Tarazed,"Gamma Aquilae (γ Aql, γ Aquilae) is a star in the constellation Aquila. It has the traditional name Tarazed. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.712, so it is readily visible to the naked eye at night. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of 395 light-years (121 parsecs) from Earth."
Altair,Altair,"Altair (α Aquilae, α Aql) is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is currently in the G-cloud—a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.
Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s. This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.

Alshain,Alshain,"Beta Aquilae (β Aql, β Aquilae) is a star in the constellation Aquila. It has the traditional name Alshain from the Perso-Arabic term الشاهين aš-šāhīn ""the (peregrine) falcon"", perhaps by folk etymology from the Persian šāhīn tarāzū (or possibly šāhīn tara zed; see γ Aquilae), the Persian name for the asterism α, β and γ Aquilae.
In Chinese, 河鼓 (Hé Gŭ), meaning River Drum, refers to an asterism consisting of β Aquilae, Altair and γ Aql. Consequently, β Aquilae itself is known as 河鼓一 (Hé Gŭ yī, English: the First Star of River Drum.)
In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Unuk al Ghyrab (عنق ألغراب - únuq al-ghuraab), which was translated into Latin as Collum Corvi, meaning the crow's neck.
Beta Aquilae has magnitude 3.71 and is of spectral class G8IV. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is approximately 44.7 light years from Earth. It has a 12th magnitude optical companion, β Aquilae B, which is 13 arcseconds away in the sky."
Deneb,Deneb,"Deneb (/ˈdɛnɛb/; α Cyg, α Cygni, Alpha Cygni) is the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus, it is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle and forms the 'head' of the Northern Cross. It is the 19th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.25. A blue-white supergiant, Deneb is also one of the most luminous nearby stars. However, its exact distance (and hence luminosity) has been difficult to calculate; it is estimated to be somewhere between 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun."
Gienah,Gienah,"Gienah is the traditional name of two stars, each marking a wing (Arabic janāħ) of its constellation:

Other spellings that are sometimes encountered are Sad es Saud, Sadalsund, and Saad el Sund.
In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Nir Saad al Saaoud, which was translated into Latin as Lucida Fortunæ Fortunarum (rather identic with R.H. Allen), meaning the brightest of luck of lucks."
Enif,Enif,"Epsilon Pegasi (ε Peg, ε Pegasi) is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Pegasus. It has the traditional name Enif (EE-nif). The name Enif is derived from the Arabic word for nose, due to its position as the muzzle of Pegasus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.4, this is a second-magnitude star that is readily visible to the naked eye. The distance to this star can be estimated using parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, yielding a value of around 690 light-years (210 parsecs).
Other traditional names for the star include Fom al Feras, Latinised to Os Equi. In Chinese, 危宿 (Wēi Sù), meaning Rooftop (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of ε Pegasi, α Aquarii and θ Peg. Consequently, ε Pegasi itself is known as 危宿三 (Wēi Sù sān, English: the Third Star of Rooftop.)"

Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the ""Southern Birds"".
The constellation's brightest star, Alpha Gruis, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet."
Matar,Matar,"USS Matar (AK-119) was a Crater-class cargo ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy for service in World War II, named after Matar, the star in constellation Pegasus. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone."
Fomalhaut,Fomalhaut,"Fomalhaut (Alpha Piscis Austrini, Alpha PsA, α Piscis Austrini, α PsA) is the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus and one of the brightest stars in the sky. It is a class A star on the main sequence approximately 25 light-years (7.7 pc) from Earth as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is classified as a Vega-like star that emits excess infrared radiation, indicating it is surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Fomalhaut, K-type star TW Piscis Austrini and M-type star LP 876-10 constitute a triple system even though the companions are separated by several degrees.
Fomalhaut holds a special significance in extrasolar planet research, as it is the center of the first stellar system with an extrasolar planet candidate (Fomalhaut b) imaged at visible wavelengths. The image was published in Science in November 2008. Fomalhaut is the third brightest star (as viewed from Earth) known to have a planetary system, after the Sun and Pollux."
Scheat,Scheat,"Beta Pegasi (β Peg, β Pegasi) is a red giant star in the constellation Pegasus. The apparent visual magnitude of this star averages 2.42, making it the second brightest star in the constellation after Epsilon Pegasi. Its traditional name is Scheat, a name that has also been used for Delta Aquarii. According to Richard H. Allen, this name comes from the Arabic Al Sā'id for ""the upper arm"", or from Sa'd. Arabian astronomers named it Mankib al Faras, meaning the ""Horse's shoulder"". It forms the upper right corner of the Great Square of Pegasus, a prominent rectangular asterism.
Based upon parallax measurements, Beta Pegasi is located about 196 light-years (60 parsecs) from the Earth. It is unusual among bright stars in having a relatively cool surface temperature compared to stars like the Sun. This star has a stellar classification of M2.3 II–III, which indicates the spectrum has characteristics partway between a bright giant and a giant star. It has expanded until it is some 95 times as large, and has a total luminosity of 1500 times that of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 3,700 K, giving the star the characteristic orange-red hue of an M-type star. The photosphere is sufficiently cool for molecules of titanium oxide to form.
Beta Pegasi is a semi-regular variable with a period of 43.3 days and a brightness that varies from magnitude +2.31 to +2.74. It is losing mass at a rate at or below 10−8 times the Sun's mass per year, which is creating an expanding shell of gas and dust with a radius of about 3,500 times the Sun's radius (16 Astronomical Units)."
Markab,Markab,"This article is about the star named Markab, for alternative meanings, see Markab (disambiguation).
Alpha Pegasi (α Peg, α Pegasi) is the third brightest star in the constellation Pegasus and one of the four stars in the asterism known as the Great Square of Pegasus. It has the traditional name Markab (or Marchab), which comes from an Arabic word مركب markab, ""the saddle of the horse"", or is mistranscription of Mankib comes from an Arabic phrase منكب الفرس Mankib al-Faras, ""(the Star of) the Shoulder (of the Constellation) of the Horse"" for β Pegasi.
Markab has a stellar classification of B9 III, indicating that it is a B-type giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has evolved beyond the main sequence. It is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 125 km/s giving a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity along the star's equator. The effective temperature of the photosphere is nearly 10,000 K and the star has expanded to nearly five times the radius of the Sun."
p Eridani,p Eridani,"p Eridani (6 Eri, DUN 5) is a binary star system in the constellation of Eridanus (the River) whose distance is approximately 26 light-years. It was found to be a double star in December 1825 by James Dunlop in Australia at his home at Paramatta, now spelt Parramatta."
