This represents two of the evolutionary stages that a massive star passes through after it has exhausted the hydrogen at its core. Beta Arae is radiating energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,582 K, which causes it to take on the orange hue of a K-type star. This enlarged star appears to be rotating slowly with a projected rotational velocity of about 5 km s−1. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomer term the star's metallicity, is more than three times the abundance in the Sun.

Auriga,Capella (star),α,13,NA,NA,34029,24608,0.08,−0.48,42,NA,"Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth brightest in the night sky and the third brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega. Its name is derived from the diminutive of the Latin feminine capra ""goat"", hence ""little she goat"". Capella also bears the Bayer designation Alpha Aurigae (often abbreviated to α Aurigae, α Aur or Alpha Aur). Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, type-G giant stars, designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 AU apart and a derived orbital period of 104 days.
Capella Aa is the brighter of the two at spectral class G8III (G8 Giant) whereas Ab is slightly smaller and of spectral class G0III (G0 Giant). Aa has a calculated mass of 3.05 times that of the Sun and Ab some 2.57 times that of the Sun. These two stars have both exhausted their core hydrogen fuel and become giant stars, though it is unclear exactly what stage they are on the stellar evolutionary pathway. The second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. They are designated Capella H and Capella L. The stars labelled Capella C through to G and I through to K are actually unrelated stars in the same visual field. The Capella system is relatively close, at only 42.8 light-years (13.1 pc) from Earth."

It is traditionally known as Almaaz, Haldus, or Al Anz. Epsilon Aurigae is an unusual eclipsing binary system comprising an F0 supergiant and a companion which is generally accepted to be a huge dark disk orbiting an unknown object, possibly a binary system of two small B-type stars. About every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae's brightness drops from an apparent visual magnitude of +2.92 to +3.83. This dimming lasts 640–730 days. In addition to this eclipse, the system also has a low amplitude pulsation with a non-consistent period of around 66 days. The distance to the system is still a subject of debate, but modern estimates place it approximately 2,000 light years from Earth.
Epsilon Aurigae was first suspected to be a variable star when German astronomer Johann Heinrich Fritsch observed it in 1821. Later observations by Eduard Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander reinforced Fritsch's initial suspicions and attracted attention to the star. Hans Ludendorff, however, was the first to study it in great detail. His work revealed that the system was an eclipsing binary variable, a star that dims when its partner obscures its light.
Epsilon Aurigae's eclipsing companion has been subject to much debate since the object does not emit as much light as is expected for an object its size. As of 2008, the most popularly accepted model for this companion object is a binary star system surrounded by a massive, opaque disk of dust; theories speculating that the object is a large, semitransparent star or a black hole have since been discarded."

CS Cam was designated B Cam by Bode, or 2H.Cam. It forms a group of stars known as the Camelopardalis R1 association, part of the Cam OB1 association. The near-identical supergiant CE Camelopardalis is located half a degree to the south.
The primary component, CS Camelopardalis A, is a blue-white B-type supergiant with a mean apparent magnitude of 4.21m. It is classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude 4.19m to 4.23m.

Camelopardalis,Alpha Camelopardali,α,9,NA,NA,30614,22783,4.26,−7.38,6936,NA,"Alpha Camelopardalis (Alpha Cam, α Camelopardalis, α Cam) is a star in the constellation Camelopardalis, with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.3. It is the third brightest star in this not very prominent circumpolar constellation, the first and second brightest stars being β Camelopardalis and CS Camelopardalis, respectively. It is the farthest constellational star, with a distance of 6000 light-years from Earth.
This star has a stellar classification of O9 Ia, with the 'Ia' indicating that it is an O-type luminous supergiant. It is a massive star with 31 times the mass of the Sun and 37 times the Sun's radius. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 30,000 K; much hotter than the Sun's effective temperature of 5,778 K, giving it the characteristic blue hue of an O-type star. It is emitting 620,000 times the luminosity of the Sun and is a weak X-ray emitter.
This star shows multiple patterns of variability. It may be a non-radial pulsating variable star, which is causing changes in the spectrum being emitted by the photosphere. The absorption lines in the optical spectrum show radial velocity variations, although there is significant uncertainty about the period. Estimates range from a period as low as 0.36 days up to 2.93 days. The stellar wind from this star is not smooth and continuous, but instead shows a behavior indicating clumping at both large and small scales. This star is losing mass rapidly through its stellar wind at a rate of approximately 6.3 × 10−6 solar masses per year, or the equivalent of the mass of the Sun every 160,000 years.
In 1968, this star was classified as a spectroscopic binary, indicating that it has an orbiting stellar companion with a period of 3.68 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.45. Subsequent studies refined the period to 3.24 days. However, in 2006 it was recognized that the changes in the spectrum were probably the result of changes in the atmosphere or stellar wind, so it is more likely a single star. Speckle interferometry observations with the 3.67 m Advanced Electro Optical System Telescope at the Haleakala Observatory failed to detect a secondary component.
In 1961, based on the criteria that the proper motion of this star indicates a space velocity of greater than 30 km/s, Alpha Camelopardalis was suggested as a candidate runaway star that had been ejected from the cluster NGC 1502. This was based upon the kinematic properties of the star and cluster, as well as the location of this star at a high galactic latitude in an area otherwise lacking in stellar associations. Over the course of a million years, this star should have moved only 1.4° across the sky, while it was estimated as being only two million years old.
Runaway stars such as this with a stellar wind that is moving at supersonic velocity through the interstellar medium have their wind confined by a bow shock due to ram pressure. The dust in this bow shock can be detected using an infrared telescope. Just such a bow shock was observed with NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. The star is traveling at a rate of somewhere between 680 and 4,200 kilometers per second: between 1.5 and 9.4 million mph."

CE Cam is embedded in a large dusty molecular cloud, part of which it illuminates as a reflection nebula (vdB15 or BFS 29).

Parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission yield a distance estimate of around 362 ly (111 pc) from Earth.

At this heat, the star is glowing with the blue-white hue of a B-type star. This star is classified as an Alpha Cygni-type variable star that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude +2.93 to +3.08 over a 24.44 day interval.

Omicron1 Canis Majoris (ο1 CMa, ο1 Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major. Johann Bayer gave two adjacent stars the Bayer designation of Omicron Canis Majoris in 1603, but without distinguishing between the stars. John Flamsteed labelled the stars as Omicron1 and Omicron2 Canis Majoris in the early 18th century, as well as giving them his own numbered designations of 16 and 24 Canis Majoris respectively. Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled it c Canis Majoris, but this was not upheld by subsequent cartographers. Its Henry Draper Catalogue designation is HD 50877. The two Omicron stars marked the centre of the Great Dog's body on Bayer's 1603 Uranometria.
The star itself is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. A cool star, its surface temperature is around 3,900 K. Around 18 times as massive as the Sun with around 530 times its diameter, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity. Interstellar dust obscures it somewhat, and its apparent magnitude is 1.12 fainter than it would be if unobscured. Thought to be around 18 million years old, Omicron1 Canis Majoris is undergoing nuclear fusion of helium in its core to generate energy and will one day explode as a type II supernova.
Lying approximately 2000 light years from Earth, Omicron1 Canis Majoris shares a common proper motion (and likely origin) with a remote open cluster of stars in the region known as Collinder 121, located around 3,500 light years (1085 parsecs) distant. Conversely, though only separated by 2 degrees from the blue supergiant Omicron2 Canis Majoris, the two appear to be unrelated."

It has a mean apparent magnitude of +3.4, making it readily visible to the naked eye and one of the brighter members of Carina. Based upon parallax measurements, it is approximately 1,600 light-years (490 parsecs) from Earth.
From the characteristics of its spectrum, l Carinae has a stellar classification of G5 Iab/Ib. This indicates the star has reached a stage in its evolution where it has expanded to become a supergiant with 169 times the radius of the Sun. As this is a massive star with 8–13 times the mass of the Sun, it rapidly burns through its supply of nuclear fuel and has become a supergiant in roughly 33 million years, after spending 15–17 million years as a main sequence star.
l Carinae is classified as a Cepheid variable star and its brightness varies over an amplitude range of 0.725 in magnitude with a long period of 35.560 days. The radial velocity of the star likewise varies by 39 km/s during each pulsation cycle. It has a compact circumstellar envelope that can be discerned using interferometry. The envelope has been resolved at an infrared wavelength of 10μm, showing a radius of 10–100 AU at a mean temperature of 100 K. The material for this envelope was supplied by mass ejected from the central star."

Carina,Eta Carina,η,NA,NA,NA,93308,NA,4.47,NA,7500,LBV,"Eta Carinae (abbreviated to η Carinae or η Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the direction of the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N.
The two main stars of the Eta Carinae system have an eccentric orbit with a period of 5.54 years. The primary is a peculiar star similar to a luminous blue variable (LBV) that was initially 150-250 M☉ of which it has lost at least 30 M☉ already, and is expected to explode as a supernova in the astronomically near future. This is the only star known to produce ultraviolet laser emission. The secondary star is hot and also highly luminous, probably of spectral class O, around 30-80 times as massive as the Sun. The system is heavily obscured by the Homunculus Nebula, material ejected from the primary during the Great Eruption. It is a member of the Trumpler 16 open cluster within the much larger Carina Nebula. Although unrelated to the star or Nebula, the weak Eta Carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to Eta Carinae."

Zeta Cephei marks the left shoulder of Cepheus, the King of Joppa (Ethiopia). It is one of the fundamental stars of the MK spectral sequence, defined as type K1.5 Ib.
Zeta Cephei is an orange supergiant star with a surface temperature of 3,853 K and eight times more massive than the Sun. The luminosity of Zeta Cephei is approximately 3,600 times that of the Sun. At a distance of about 840 light-years, Zeta Cephei has an apparent magnitude (m) of 3.4 and an absolute magnitude (M) of -4.7. The star has a metallicity approximately 1.6 times that of the Sun; i.e., it contains 1.6 times as much heavy-element material as the Sun.
Hekker et al. (2008) have detected a periodicity of 533 days, hinting at the possible presence of an as yet unseen companion. It is listed as a possible eclipsing binary with a very small amplitude.
At the edge of the 8 to 10 solar mass (M☉) limit at which stars develop iron cores and then explode as supernovae, Zeta Cephei's most likely fate is to produce a very massive white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4 M☉) at which such dense remnants can survive. If Zeta Cephei is a binary star; i.e., if there is a stellar companion, and it is close enough to feed sufficient matter to the white-dwarf-to-be, it is marginally possible that the limit could be overflowed, resulting in the white dwarf's collapse and a Type Ia supernova explosion."

It was discovered in 1915 by the Scottish astronomer Robert Innes, the Director of the Union Observatory in South Africa, and is the nearest known star to the Sun, although it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 11.05. Its distance to the second- and third-nearest stars, which form the bright binary Alpha Centauri, is 0.237 ± 0.011 ly (15,000 ± 700 AU). Proxima Centauri is very likely part of a triple star system with Alpha Centauri A and B, but its orbital period may be greater than 500,000 years.
Because of Proxima Centauri's proximity to Earth, its angular diameter can be measured directly, from which it can be determined that its diameter is about one-seventh of that of the Sun. It has a mass about an eighth of the Sun's mass (M☉), and its average density is about 40 times that of the Sun. Although it has a very low average luminosity, Proxima is a flare star that undergoes random dramatic increases in brightness because of magnetic activity. The star's magnetic field is created by convection throughout the stellar body, and the resulting flare activity generates a total X-ray emission similar to that produced by the Sun. The mixing of the fuel at Proxima Centauri's core through convection and its relatively low energy-production rate mean that it will be a main-sequence star for another four trillion years, or nearly 300 times the current age of the universe.
Searches for companions orbiting Proxima Centauri have been unsuccessful, ruling out the presence of brown dwarfs and supermassive planets. Precision radial velocity surveys have also ruled out the presence of super-Earths within the star's habitable zone. The detection of smaller objects will require the use of new instruments, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled for deployment in 2018. Because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf and a flare star, whether a planet orbiting it could support life is disputed. Nevertheless, because of the star's proximity to Earth, it has been proposed as a destination for interstellar travel."

This allows it to be viewed from most of Earth's surface. At a distance of 10.5 light years (ly), it has an apparent magnitude of 3.73. It is the third closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye and was the closest star known to host a planet until the unconfirmed discovery of Alpha Centauri Bb. Its age is estimated at less than a billion years. Because of its youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2 days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5,000 K, giving it an orange hue.
The motion of Epsilon Eridani along the line of sight to Earth, known as the radial velocity, has been regularly observed for more than twenty years. Periodic changes in this data yielded evidence of a giant planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, making it one of the nearest extrasolar systems with a candidate exoplanet. This object, Epsilon Eridani b, was formally announced in 2000 by a team of astronomers led by Artie Hatzes. Current data indicate that this planet orbits with a period of about 7 years at a mean separation of 3.4 astronomical units (AU), where 1 AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Although this discovery has been controversial because of the amount of background noise in the radial velocity data, many astronomers now regard the planet as confirmed.
The system includes two belts of rocky asteroids: one at about 3 AU and a second at about 20 AU, whose structure may be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani harbors an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals left over from the system's formation.
Epsilon Eridani's designation was established in 1603 by Johann Bayer. It may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar motion through the Milky Way, implying these stars shared a common origin in an open cluster. Its nearest neighbor, the binary star system Luyten 726-8, will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years when they will be separated by about 0.93 ly. As one of the nearest Sun-like stars with the potential for a planet that may harbor life, Epsilon Eridani has been the target of SETI searches. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.

It is located at a distance of about 29.78 light-years (9.13 parsecs) from Earth. The Greek letter beta (β) usually indicates that the star has the second highest visual magnitude in the constellation. However, with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.3, this star is slightly brighter than α Comae Berenices. It can be seen with the naked eye, but may be too dim to be viewed from a built-up urban area.
This star is similar to our own Sun, being only slightly larger and brighter in absolute magnitude. It has a stellar classification of G0 V, compared to G2 V for the Sun. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 5,936 K, giving it a yellow hue of a G-type star. In terms of age it is younger than the Sun, being about 3 billion years old.
Observations of short term variations in the chromatic activity suggest that the star undergoes differential rotation, with a rotation period of about 11–13 days. Its surface has a measured activity cycle of 16.6 years, compared to 11 years on our Sun. It may also have a secondary activity cycle of 9.6 years. At one time it was thought that this star might have a spectroscopic companion. However, this was ruled out by means of more accurate radial velocity measurements. No planets have yet been detected around it, and there is no evidence of a dusty disk.
The habitable zone for this star, defined as the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet, is 0.918–1.042 AU, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun."

It is a 4th magnitude star, which can be seen with the naked eye under suitably dark skies. Parallax measurements give an estimated distance of 1,100 light-years (320 parsecs) from the Earth. However, Schröder et al. (2007) suggest the actual value, after correcting for Malmquist bias, may be closer to 1,174 light-years (360 parsecs). Although it is a spectrsocopic binary with components that cannot be separated visually, it has two entries in the Henry Draper Catalogue, with identical magnitudes and positions, but showing the spectral types of the two components.
The primary component in this system, 32 Cygni A, has a stellar classification of K5 Iab, indicating that it is a supergiant star. Its effective temperature of 3,840 K lies in the range for K-type stars, giving it an orange hue. This star has more four than times the mass of the Sun and the outer envelope has expanded to about 184 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 6,600 times the luminosity of the Sun.
The companion star, 32 Cygni B, is smaller than the primary, with four times the Sun's mass and three times the Sun's radius. It has a much higher effective temperature of 16,200 K and is radiating over 300 times the Sun's luminosity. This star has the blue-white hue of a B7 star main sequence star.
The two stars form an eclipsing binary system (variable star designation: V1488 Cyg) similar to Algol. The orbital plane of the two stars is nearly aligned with the line of sight from the Earth, so that the giant star eclipses the secondary component once per orbit. During an eclipse, emission lines can be seen in the spectrum of this system. These originate in the stellar wind escaping from the giant star. In a volume around the B star, this wind becomes ionized, resulting in a circumstellar H II region. The giant star is losing mass at the rate of 1.3 × 10−8 times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 77 million years.
The Washington Double Star Catalog and Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars both list a visual companion 208"" distant. This star is the 8th magnitude A class HD 192933.

It has the traditional name Acamar from the Arabic آخِر النَّهْر Ākhir an-nahr which means ""the end of the river"". Historically, Acamar represented the end of the constellation Eridanus. Now that distinction is held by the star Achernar, a star which shares the same Arabic etymology. Achernar is not visible from the Greek isles (latitudes > 33° North), hence the choice of Acamar as the river's end during the time of Hipparchus and later Ptolemy.
The term Ākhir an-nahr or Achr al Nahr was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as Postrema Fluminis.
In Chinese, 天園 (Tiān Yuán), meaning Celestial Orchard, refers to an asterism consisting of θ Eridani, χ Eridani, φ Eridani, κ Eridani, HD 16754, HD 23319, HD 24072, HD 24160, υ4 Eridani, 43 Eridani, υ2 Eridani and υ1 Eridani. Consequently, θ Eridani itself is known as 天園六 (Tiān Yuán liù, English: the Sixth Star of Celestial Orchard.)
Acamar is a double star with some evidence suggesting it is part of a multiple star system. The main star, θ1 Eri, is of the spectral class A4 and has a +3.2 apparent magnitude. Its companion star, θ2 Eri, is of the spectral class A1 and has an apparent magnitude of +4.3. The angular separation of the two stars is equal to 8.3 arcseconds. Acamar's distance from Earth as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite is approximately 120 light-years.
Ptolemy described Acamar as a first-magnitude star, which some have taken to be in fact Achernar, which today appears just above the horizon in Alexandria where Ptolemy lived.
Achernar, however, was not visible to Ptolemy (it is from Alexandria today due to precession); its declination in 100CE was -67, making it invisible even at Aswan. Ptolemy's Eridanus thus without doubt ended at Acamar, which rose about 10 degrees above the horizon from Alexandria. This fact besides positively identifying Acamar as the original ""end of the river"", also strengthens the case for Acamar having been first magnitude in ancient times."

Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of roughly 211 light-years (65 parsecs) from Earth. Analysis of the spectrum shows it to match a stellar classification of B8 III, with the luminosity class of III indicating this is a giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. The luminosity of Gamma Gruis is around 390 times that of the Sun, with a significant portion of the energy emission being in the ultraviolet. Its outer envelope has an effective temperature of 12,520 K, which give the star a blue-white hue. Gamma Gruis is rotating relatively rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 57 km s−1. By way of comparison, the Sun has an azimuthal velocity along its equator of just 2 km s−1.
Based upon analysis of data collected during the Hipparcos mission, this star may have a proper motion companion that is causing gravitational perturbation of Gamma Gruis."

Grus,Pi1 Grui,π,NA,NA,NA,212087,110478,6.42,0.50,498,NA,"Pi1 Gruis is a star in the constellation Grus. It is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from apparent magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 over a period of 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. It is one of the brightest stars of a class of stars known as S Stars, and has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 that is sunlike in properties—a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. Separated by 2.71′′, the pair make up a likely binary system. The primary star has a measured diameter of 21 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a diameter 694 times that of the Sun. It is an ageing star, thought be well on its way transitioning from a red giant to a planetary nebula. A shell of material has been detected at a distance of 0.91 light-years (0.28 parsecs), which is estimated to have been ejected 21,000 years ago. Closer to the star, there appears to be a cavity within 200 AU, suggesting a drop off in the ejection of material in the past 90 years. The presence of one companion makes the shape of the shell irregular (rather than spherical), and there may as yet be another undetected companion contributing to this.
The star was catalogued by French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1756 but not given a name. Instead, he gave the Bayer designation of ""Pi Gruis"" to Pi2 Gruis. It was Thomas Brisbane who designated this star as Pi1. Annie Jump Cannon was the first to report its unusual spectrum, sending a plate of its spectrograph made in 1895 to Paul W. Merrill and noting its similarity to R Andromedae. Merrill selected these two stars along with R Cygni to be the three prototypes of the S Star class. Pi1 Gruis was one of the first 17 stars defined as S-stars by Merrill in 1922; the only star not observed from Mount Wilson due to its southerly location in the sky. Analysis of its spectrum showed bands indicating the presence of technetium, as well as oxides of zirconium, lanthanum, cerium and yttrium but not titanium nor barium (which have been recorded in other S stars)."
Hercules,Beta Herculi,β,27,NA,NA,148856,80816,2.78,−0.50,148,G8III,"Beta Herculis (Beta Her, β Herculis, β Her), which has the traditional name Kornephoros, is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Hercules at a base apparent visual magnitude of 2.81. This is a suspected variable star with an apparent magnitude that may rise as high as 2.76. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of 139 light-years (43 parsecs) from Earth.
Although β Herculis appears to the naked eye to be a single star, in July 1899 the American astronomer W. W. Campbell discovered from spectroscopic measurements that its radial velocity varies, and concluded that it is a binary system. An orbit for the binary was computed in 1908 based upon additional spectroscopic measurements.
At Palomar Observatory, Antoine Labeyrie and others used speckle interferometry with the Hale Telescope to resolve the system in 1977. The Hipparcos satellite observed the orbital motion of the primary relative to other stars, and an orbit was computed in 2005 using spectroscopic data together with these measurements. The period of the system is around 410 days. They have a high orbital eccentricity of 0.55 and the orbital plane is inclined 53.8° to the line of sight from the Earth.
The primary star in this binary system has a stellar classification of G7 IIIa, indicating that it is a giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. It has a mass nearly three times the mass of the Sun, and has expanded to 17 times the Sun's radius.

The primary member is a subgiant star that is somewhat larger than the Sun and has just begun to evolve away from the main sequence as the supply of hydrogen at its core becomes exhausted. It is orbited by a smaller companion star at a mean angular separation of 1.5 arcseconds, which corresponds to a physical separation of about 15 Astronomical Units. This distance is large enough so that the two stars do not have a significant tidal effect on each other. The stars orbit each other over a period of 34.45 years, with a semi-major axis of 1.33"" and an eccentricity of 0.46.
Component A has a stellar classification of F9 IV. It has about 2.6 times the radius of the Sun and 1.45 times the Sun's mass.

Hercules,99 Herculi,b,99,NA,NA,165908,88745,5.05,4.08,51,F7V,"99 Herculis is the Flamsteed designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Hercules. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.1, which, according to the Bortle scale, makes it faintly visible to the naked eye from suburban skies. Measurements made with the Hipparcos spacecraft show an annual parallax shift of 0.064″, corresponding to a physical distance of about 51.0 ly (15.6 pc) from the Sun.
The binary nature of this star system was first discovered in 1859 by English astronomer W. R. Dawes. The two stellar components orbit around their common center of mass, or barycenter, with a period of 56.3 years and an eccentricity of 0.766. The semi-major axis of their orbit spans an angle of 1.06 arcseconds, which corresponds to a physical dimension of 16.5 AU. The plane of their orbit is inclined by an angle of about 39° to the line-of-sight from the Earth. Reports of a third component of this system now appear doubtful.
The primary component, 99 Herculis A, is an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F7 V. It has 94% of the Sun's mass and nearly double the luminosity, but has an estimated 10% greater radius. The effective temperature of the star's outer atmosphere is 5,938 K, giving it a white-hued glow. This is a metal-poor star, showing overall abundances of elements—other than hydrogen or helium—equal to 60% of those in the Sun.
The secondary component, 99 Herculis B, is fainter by 3.35 magnitudes compared to the primary. It is a K-type main sequence star with a classification of K4 V. With 46% of the mass of the Sun, it has 74% of the Sun's radius but shines with just 14% of the Sun's luminosity.
Images from the Herschel Space Observatory show that a disk of dusty debris is orbiting the barycenter at an average radius of 120 AU. Oddly, the disk appears to be misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary system. This may be the result of an interaction within another star system some time in the past. Most of the disk emission appears to be caused by icy objects having a diameter of 10 cm or less, with a net mass of about ten times the mass of the Earth."

The distance from Earth can be directly determined from parallax measurements, yielding a value of about 165 light-years (51 parsecs).
This is a large star with 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of A2 V, making this a seemingly typical A-type main sequence star. However, the spectrum shows enhanced absorption lines of metals, marking this as a chemically peculiar Am star. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, appears around 12% higher than in the Sun. It is radiating 141 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 9,350 K, literally giving it a white-hot glow.
Theta Leonis is much younger than the Sun, with an estimated age of around 550 million years. It has a moderately high rate of rotation, with a projected rotational velocity of 23 km s−1.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.9, this star can be readily seen with the naked eye at night. Parallax measurements give a distance estimate of about 5,400 light-years (1,700 parsecs) from the Earth.
This is an enormous star with about 21 times the Sun's mass (M☉) and 37 times the Sun's radius. Its spectrum matches a stellar classification of B1 Iab, with the 'Iab' luminosity class indicating that it is in the supergiant stage of its evolution. Rho Leonis is radiating about 295,000 times the Sun's luminosity at an effective temperature of 24,200 K, giving it the blue-white hue typical of a B-type star. A strong stellar wind is expelling mass from the outer envelope at a rate of 3.5 × 10−7 M☉ per year, or the equivalent of 1 M☉ every 2.8 million years. The rotation rate is probably about once per 7 days, with an upper limit of 47 days.
Rho Leonis is classified as a runaway star, which means it has a peculiar velocity of at least 30 km s−1 relative to the surrounding stars. It has radial velocity of 42 km s−1 away from the Sun and a proper motion that is carrying it about 1.56 Astronomical Units per year, equivalent to 7 km s−1, in a transverse direction. The star is situated about 2,300 light-years (710 parsecs) above the galactic plane.
Rho Leo is sometimes occulted by the moon and unusual light variation during these occultations has been explained as the result of a possible close companion.

This is a massive star with about 14 times the mass of the Sun. The interferometer-measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is 1.77 ± 0.09 mas. At an estimated distance of 2,218 light-years (680 parsecs), this yields a physical size of about 129 times the radius of the Sun. Alpha Leporis has a stellar classification of F0 Ib, with the Ib luminosity class indicating that it is a lower luminosity supergiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is about 6,850 K, which gives the star a yellow-white hue that is typical of F-type stars. It is an estimated 13 million years old.
Alpha Leporis is an older, dying star that may have already passed through a supergiant phase and is now contracting and heating up in the latter phases of stellar evolution, or perhaps is still expanding into the supergiant phase. Based upon its estimated mass, it is expected to end its life in a spectacular stellar explosion known as a supernova."

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.84 and a stellar classification of G5 II. The mass of this star is 3.5 times the mass of the Sun and it is about 240 million years old, which is sufficient time for a star this massive to consume the hydrogen at its core and evolve away from the main sequence, becoming a G-type bright giant.
This is a double star system and may be a binary. Using adaptive optics on the AEOS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, the pair was found to be separated by an angle of 2.58 arcseconds at a position angle of 1.4°.

This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K4 III that has expanded to 40 times the Sun's radius. It is about 1.72 billion years old and has 1.70 times the mass of the Sun, with a luminosity 372 times as great. The outer atmosphere is cooler than the Sun's with an effective temperature of 4,131 K, giving it the orange hue of a K-type star. In terms of its composition, this star shows a similar abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium to the Sun.
The envelope of this star is undergoing oscillations that show up as changes in the star's radial velocity. Over long durations these follow a linear trend, in combination with shorter period oscillations occurring over a few days. These oscillations are unlikely to be the result of rotational module as that would imply a high rotation rate, which would display itself through strong X-ray emissions.

Lupus,Epsilon Lup,ε,NA,NA,NA,136504,75264,3.37,−2.58,504,NA,"Epsilon Lupi (ε Lup) is a multiple star system in the southern constellation of Lupus. At an apparent visual magnitude of 3.41, Epsilon Lupi can be readily viewed from the southern hemisphere with sufficiently dark skies. It is the fifth brightest star or star system in the constellation. Parallax measurements give a distance to this system of roughly 510 light-years (160 parsecs).
This system is what astronomers term a double-lined spectroscopic binary. When the spectrum is examined, the absorption line features of both stars can be viewed. As a result of the Doppler effect, these lines shift back and forth in frequency as the two stars orbit around each other. This allows some of their orbital elements to be deduced, even though the individual stars have not been resolved with a telescope. The pair share a close, elliptical orbit with a period of 4.55970 days. The orbital eccentricity is 0.277, which means that at the separation at closest approach, or periapsis, is only 57% of the distance at their greatest separation, or apoapsis. There is a third, more distant companion at an angular separation of 26.5 arcseconds that may be orbiting the pair with a period of about 64 years.
The pair that share the close orbit, Epsilon Lupi A and Epsilon Lupi a, have estimated masses of 13.24 and 11.46 times the mass of the Sun, respectively. The more distant component, Epsilon Lupi B, has a mass of about 7.64 times the Sun. The combined stellar classification of the system is B2 IV-V, while the individual components may have spectral classes of B3 IV, B3 V, and A5 V, in order of decreasing mass. The inner A-a pair appear to have their rate of spin synchronized with their orbit, so that the same face of each star always faces its partner. The secondary, Epsilon Lupi a, shows regular variation in luminosity of the type that occurs with Beta Cephei variables, at a periodicity of 10.36 cycles per day.
This star system is a probable member of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a moving group of stars that originated together and share a similar trajectory through space.

Unusually, it is the only star in the constellation that has a Bayer designation. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located about 203 light-years (62 parsecs) from the Earth.
This is a giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has evolved away from the main sequence. It has expanded to about 55 times the Sun's radius and it is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The estimated effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is 3,882 K, which is lower than the Sun's effective temperature of 5,778 K, and is giving Alpha Lyncis an orange hue that is characteristic of K-type stars.
Alpha Lyncis is a suspected small-amplitude red variable star that changes apparent magnitude from +3.17 up to +3.12. This variability pattern typically occurs in stars that have developed an inert carbon core surrounded by a helium-fusing shell, and suggests that Alpha Lyncis is starting to evolve into a Mira-type variable."

It is a relatively close star at only 25 light-years from Earth, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.
Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed ""arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun."" Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements.

Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator.

From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.

This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System.

It puts out more energy than 10,000 suns, although more than 90% of it at longer than visual wavelengths. Direct angular measurements, combined with the Hipparcos parallax, give a radius of 1.1 - 1.3 astronomical units, comparable to the size calculated from other observed data.
It began life as a hot blue main sequence star, but now is a large cool asymptotic giant branch star with a degenerate helium core. It is a semi-regular variable star that has its brightness change by 0.2 magnitudes over an ill-defined period. Delta2 Lyrae was once thought to form a visual binary with the star Delta1 Lyrae, but it does not, only appearing to do so if seen from earth's direction.
The spectral type of the nearby star system CCDM J18545+3654BC suggests that they are at the same distance as Delta2 Lyrae, which could mean that the three stars form a triple star system. In this case, CCDM J18545+3654BC would be 24,000 AU away from Delta2 Lyrae, and it would take 24,000 years for it to make an orbit.

Distinctly reddish, it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.0 and 1.3, the widest range of any first-magnitude star. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle, and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon. The star's name is derived from the Arabic إبط الجوزاء Ibt al-Jauzā' or يد الجوزاء Yad al-Jauzā', meaning ""the hand of Orion"".
The star is classified as a red supergiant of spectral type M1-2 and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained, but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun. Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light-years, yielding a mean absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this crimson runaway has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova within the next million years. An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.
In 1920, Betelgeuse became the second star (after the Sun) to have the angular size of its photosphere measured. Since then, researchers have used telescopes with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant, often with conflicting results. Studies since 1990 have produced an angular diameter (apparent size) ranging from 0.043 to 0.056 arcseconds, an incongruity largely caused by the star's tendency to periodically change shape. Due to limb darkening, variability, and angular diameters that vary with wavelength, many of the star's properties are not yet known with any certainty. Adding to these challenges, the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex, asymmetric envelope roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by colossal mass loss.

Iota Orionis is the brightest star in an asterism known as Orion's sword. It has the traditional names Hatsya or Hatysa and in Arabic, Na’ir al Saif, which means simply ""the Bright One of the Sword."" From parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly 1,330 light-years (410 parsecs) from Earth.
Iota Orionis is a quadruple system dominated by a massive spectroscopic binary with an eccentric (e=0.764), 29-day orbit. The two components of ι Ori A are a stellar class O9 III star (blue giant) and a class B0.8 III/IV star about 2 magnitudes fainter. The collision of the stellar winds from this pair makes the system a strong X-ray source. Oddly, the two objects of this system appear to have different ages, with the secondary being about double the age of the primary. In combination with the high eccentricity of their orbit, this suggests that the binary system was created through a capture, rather than by being formed together and undergoing a mass transfer. This capture may have occurred, for example, through an encounter between two binary systems.
ι Ori has a B8 giant companion at 11"" (approximately 5,000 AU) which has been shown to be variable, and likely to be a young stellar object. There is also a fainter A0 star at 49"" catalogued as ι Ori C."
Orion,Pi³ Orionis,π,1,NA,NA,30652,22449,3.19,3.67,26,F6V,"Pi3 Orionis (π3 Ori, π3 Orionis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Orion. It has the traditional name of Tabit and the Flamsteed designation 1 Orionis. At an apparent visual magnitude of 3.16, it is readily visible to the naked eye. Pi3 Orionis is the brightest star in the lion's hide (or shield) that Orion is holding. The distance to this star, as measured using the parallax technique, is 26.32 light-years (8.07 parsecs). Though no extrasolar planets have been observed around Pi3 Orionis, the star is considered a prime location for planets as small as the Earth.
Pi3 Orionis is a main-sequence star of spectral type F6 V. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Compared to the Sun, it has about 124% of the mass, 132% of the radius, and nearly 3 times the luminosity. This energy is being radiated from the star's outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,516 K, giving it the yellow-white glow of an F-type star. Pi3 Orionis is most likely single; a nearby star is probably an optical companion.
Although a periodicity of 73.26 days has been observed in the star's radial velocity, it seems likely to be bound more to stellar activity than to a planetary object in close orbit. No substellar companion has been detected so far around Pi3 Orionis and the McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets with masses between 0.84 and 46.7 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 astronomical units. Thus, so far it appears that an Earth-like planet could easily orbit the star without any complications caused by a gravitationally perturbing body."

χ1 Ori is a G0V star. It has a faint companion with a mass estimated at about 15% of the mass of the Sun, an orbital period of 14.1 years, and an estimated stellar class of M6. The companion orbits an average distance of 6.1 AU from the primary, but has a fairly high orbital eccentricity, ranging from 3.3 AU out to 8.9 AU from the primary. Because of this red dwarf companion, the likelihood of habitable planets in this system is low.
A necessary condition for the existence of a planet in this system are stable zones where the object can remain in orbit for long intervals. For hypothetical planets in a circular orbit around the individual members of this star system, this maximum orbital radius is computed to be 1.01 AU for the primary and 0.41 AU for the secondary.

Pavo,Alpha Pavoni,α,NA,NA,NA,193924,100751,1.94,−1.81,183,B2IV,"Alpha Pavonis (α Pav) is a star in the southern constellation Pavo, near the shared border with the Telescopium constellation. It is also known by the name Peacock, which was assigned by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s during the creation of the Air Almanac, a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty-seven stars included in the new almanac, two had no classical names: Epsilon Carinae and Alpha Pavonis. The RAF insisted that all of the stars must have names, so new names were invented. Alpha Pavonis was named ""Peacock"" ('pavo' is Latin for 'peacock') whilst Epsilon Carinae was called ""Avior"".
At an apparent magnitude of 1.94, this is the brightest star in Pavo. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is about 179 light-years (55 parsecs) distant from the Earth. It has an estimated six times the Sun's mass and 5–6 times the Sun's radius, but 2,200 times the luminosity of the Sun. However, Tetzlaff et al. (2011) suggest a much higher mass of 9 times the mass of the Sun. The effective temperature of the photosphere is 18,000 K, which gives the star a blue-white hue. A stellar classification of B2 IV suggests it is a subgiant star that has begun to evolve from the main sequence with the exhaustion of the hydrogen at its core.
Stars with the mass of Alpha Pavonis are believed not to have a convection zone near their surface. Hence the material found in the outer atmosphere is not processed by the nuclear fusion occurring at the core. This means that the surface abundance of elements should be representative of the material out of which it originally formed. In particular, the surface abundance of deuterium should not change during the star's main sequence lifetime. The measured ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in this star amounts to less than 5 × 10−6, which suggests this star may have formed in a region with an unusually low abundance of deuterium, or else the deuterium was consumed by some means. A possible scenario for the latter is that the deuterium was burned through while Alpha Pavonis was a pre-main-sequence star.
Alpha Pavonis is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a pair of stars that orbit around each other with a period of 11.753 days. However, in part because the two stars have not been individually resolved, little is known about the companion. The system may be a member of the Tucana-Horologium association of stars that share a common motion through space. The estimated age of this association is 30 million years, which, as the members share a common origin, suggests a similar age for Alpha Pavonis. However, Tetzlaff et al. (2011) suggest an age for this star of only 200,000 years. This star has a peculiar velocity of 13 km s−1 relative to its neighbors."

The Beta Pictoris system is very young, only 8–20 million years old, although it is already in the main sequence stage of its evolution. Beta Pictoris is the title member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, an association of young stars which share the same motion through space and have the same age.
Beta Pictoris shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, which was the first debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has confirmed the presence of a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. This planet is currently the closest extrasolar planet to its star ever photographed: the observed separation is roughly the same as the distance between Saturn and the Sun."

Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is classified as a Vega-like star that emits excess infrared radiation, indicating it is surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Fomalhaut, K-type star TW Piscis Austrini and M-type star LP 876-10 constitute a triple system even though the companions are separated by several degrees.
Fomalhaut holds a special significance in extrasolar planet research, as it is the center of the first stellar system with an extrasolar planet candidate (Fomalhaut b) imaged at visible wavelengths. The image was published in Science in November 2008. Fomalhaut is the third brightest star (as viewed from Earth) known to have a planetary system, after the Sun and Pollux."

It is also known by the traditional names Naos (/ˈneɪ.ɒs/, from the Greek ναύς ""ship"") and Suhail Hadar (سهيل هدار, possibly ""roaring bright one"") in Arabic.
The spectral class of O4 means this is one of the hottest, and most luminous, stars visible to the naked eye. It is one of the sky's few naked-eye class O-type stars as well as one of the closest to Earth. It is a blue supergiant, one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. Visually it is over 10,000 times brighter than the Sun, but its high temperature means that most of its radiation is in the ultraviolet and its bolometric luminosity is over 500,000 times that of the Sun. It is also the 62nd brightest star in terms of apparent magnitude from Earth.
Zeta Puppis is typical of O-type stars in having an extremely strong stellar wind, measured at 2,500 km/s, which sees the star shed more than a millionth of its mass each year, or about 10 million times that shed by our own Sun over a comparable time period."

This is a double star with a magnitude 6.86 companion at an angular separation of 0.72 arcsecond and a position angle of 148°.
The spectrum of Pi Puppis matches a stellar classification of K3 Ib. The Ib luminosity class indicates this a lower luminosity supergiant star that has consumed the hydrogen fuel at its core, evolved away from the main sequence, and expanded to about 290 times the Sun's radius. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 4,000 K, which gives it the orange hue of a K-type star. It is a semiregular variable star that varies in apparent magnitude from a high of 2.70 down to 2.85. Pi Puppis is the brightest star in the open cluster Collinder 135."
Puppis,Rho Puppi,ρ,15,253,NA,67523,39757,2.83,1.41,63,F2mF5IIp,"Rho Puppis (Rho Pup, ρ Puppis, ρ Pup) is a star in the southern constellation of Puppis, which according to British astronomy author Patrick Moore, has the traditional name Turais, which is shared by Iota Carinae. With an average apparent visual magnitude of 2.78, it is the third brightest member of this generally faint constellation. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, Rho Puppis is located at a distance of 63.5 light-years (19.5 parsecs) from Earth. At present it is moving away from the Sun with a radial velocity of +46.1 km s−1. The closest approach occurred about 394,000 years ago when Rho Puppis came within roughly 11.6 ly (3.6 pc) of the Solar System; about the same distance as Procyon in the present era.
The variability of this star was announced in 1956 by American astronomer Olin J. Eggen. It was determined to be a Delta Scuti-type variable star, making it one of the first stars of that type to be identified. Photometric observations dating back to 1946 provide a lengthy record of its pattern of pulsation; it undergoes periodic pulsations with a single period of 0.14088143(3) days, or 7.1 cycles per day. During each cycle, the star's magnitude varies with an amplitude of 0.15 and the radial velocity varies by 10 km s−1. The peak brightness occurs 28.8 minutes following the minimum radial velocity. The outer atmosphere's effective temperature of 6,920 K is one of the lowest known for a Delta Scuti variable.
Rho Puppis has an estimated age of about 2 billion years and it has 3.4 times the Sun's radius. It has a stellar classification of F2mF5IIp, which matches the spectrum of an F-type bright giant star. It shows stronger than normal absorption lines of metals—a term astronomers use for any element other than hydrogen and helium. The 'p' suffix indicates chemical peculiarities that mark it as a cooler temperature Am star. Most such stars are found in binary star systems, but this appears to be an exception as no companion has been discovered. Evolved stars that show this combination of Delta Scuti variability with Am-like peculiarities of abundance have come to be known as ρ Pup stars. The star's metallicity is more than double that in the Sun.
This star shows an excess emission of infrared radiation, suggesting that there is a circumstellar disk of dust orbiting this star. The mean temperature of the emission is 85 K, corresponding to an orbital separation from the host star of 50 AU.

Puppis,Tau Puppi,τ,NA,39,NA,50310,32768,2.94,−0.80,183,NA,"Tau Puppis (Tau Pup, τ Puppis, τ Pup) is a star in the southern constellation of Puppis. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.95 and is located at a distance of about 182 light-years (56 parsecs) from Earth. This is a spectroscopic binary star system, with the presence of the secondary component being revealed by the shifts of absorption lines in the spectrum resulting from the Doppler effect. The two components orbit each other with a period of 1,066.0 days (2.9 years) and a low eccentricity of 0.090.
The primary component of this system has a stellar classification of K1 III. A luminosity class 'III' indicates this has expanded into a giant star after exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolving away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is 4.49 ± 0.07 mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 27 times the radius of the Sun. It appears to be rotating slowly, with a projected rotational velocity of 2.2 km s−1. This gives a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity of rotation along the star's equator. Tau Puppis is radiating energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of around 4,500, giving it the orange hue of a cool, K-type star."

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.25, which is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye at night from the southern hemisphere. Through a telescope, it appears as an bright, orange-hued star with a nearby white companion. Parallax measurements indicate this star is located at a distance of about 194 light-years (59 parsecs) from Earth.
This is a spectroscopic binary system, consisting of an orbiting pair of stars that have not been individually resolved with a telescope. Their orbital period is 257.8 days and the eccentricity is 0.17. The pair form an eclipsing binary of the Beta Lyrae type and a period of 130.5 days, or one half of their orbital period. The eclipse of the primary component causes a decline of 0.04 magnitudes, while the secondary eclipse reduces the magnitude by 0.03.
The combined stellar classification is K5 III, which matches the spectrum of a giant star. The measured angular diameter of the primary star is 16.71 ± 2.84 mas. At the estimated distance of this system, this yields a physical size of about 107 times the radius of the Sun. The primary component shows the behavior of a slow irregular variable.
In addition to its binary components, Sigma Puppis has a more distant companion that has a matching proper motion, suggesting that it may be gravitationally bound to the binary. This magnitude 8.5 star is at an angular separation of 22.4 arcseconds with a position angle of 74° from Sigma Puppis, which is equivalent to a projected separation of 1,200 Astronomical Units. In 1970, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen suggested that Sigma Puppis belonged to a moving group of stars that share a similar motion through space, and thereby a common origin. It served as the eponym for this, the σ Puppis group. The existence of this group was later brought into question."

It is a slow irregular variable star with the quoted magnitude of +0.96. Antares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association (the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, which contains thousands of stars with mean age 11 million years at a distance of approximately 145 parsecs (470 light years)."

It has the traditional names Acrab, Akrab or Elacrab, all come from (Arabic: العقرب‎) al-'Aqrab, the Scorpion, for the whole constellation, as well as Graffias, a name it shares with Xi Scorpii. It was known as 房宿四 (the Fourth star of the Room) in Chinese.

Observed through a small telescope, Beta Scorpii appears as a binary star with a separation between the two components of 13.5 arcseconds and a combined apparent magnitude of 2.50. This pair, β1 and β2, form the top branches of the hierarchy of orbiting components in this system. β1 Scorpii, the brighter of the pair, consists of two sub-components, β Sco A and β Sco B, orbiting at an angular separation of 3.9 arcseconds with an orbital period of 610 years. β Sco A is itself a spectroscopic binary with the components β Sco Aa and β Sco Ab separated by 1.42 milliarcseconds and an orbital period of 6.82 days.
The second visual component, β2 Scorpii, has two sub-components, β Sco C and β Sco E, orbiting at an angular separation of 0.1328 arcseconds with an orbital period of 39 years. β Sco E is a spectroscopic binary with the components β Sco Ea and β Sco Eb having an orbital period of 10.7 days. This brings the total number of stars in the system to six. There is no D component; this is now an artifact of earlier system models.
The two most massive members of the system have the spectrum of B-type main sequence stars. Component C has a stellar classification of B2V. They are both hot stars at least 10 times as massive as our own Sun, and will have short lives. Both are expected to end their stellar evolution with massive Type II supernova explosions.
The Beta Scorpii system is a kinematic member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a group of thousands of young stars with mean age 11 million years at distance 470 light years (145 parsecs). A recent analysis of the HR diagram position for the most massive star Beta-1 Scorpii A estimates its effective temperature to be 26,240 Kelvin with a luminosity of 19,500 Suns, consistent with an isochronal age of 11 million years and an estimated mass of 12 solar masses.

Scorpius,Upsilon Scorpi,υ,34,NA,NA,158408,85696,2.70,−3.31,518,B2IV,"Upsilon Scorpii (υ Sco, υ Scorpii) is a star located in the ""stinger"" of the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius, the scorpion. It has the traditional name Lesath (alternative spellings Leschath, Lesuth), from Arabic las'a = ""pass (or bite) of a poisonous animal""; but this is a miscorrection by Scaliger (a European astronomer who knew Arabic) for earlier ""Alascha"", which came from Arabic al laţkha = ""the foggy patch"", referring to the nearby open cluster M7. On the night sky it lies near the 1.6 magnitude star Lambda Scorpii, so the two form an optical pair that is sometimes called the ""Cat's Eyes"".
This star has apparent magnitude +2.7 and belongs to spectral class B2 IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating it is a subgiant star. From parallax measurements, it is approximately 580 light years from Earth. The star's luminosity is 12,300 times that of the Sun, while its surface temperature is 22,831 kelvins. The star has a radius of 6.1 times solar and 11 times the mass of the Sun.

Scorpius,Beta2 Scorpii,β,NA,NA,NA,144218,78821,4.90,−2.80,530,B2V,"Beta Scorpii (β Sco, β Scorpii) is a multiple star system in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. It has the traditional names Acrab, Akrab or Elacrab, all come from (Arabic: العقرب‎) al-'Aqrab, the Scorpion, for the whole constellation, as well as Graffias, a name it shares with Xi Scorpii. It was known as 房宿四 (the Fourth star of the Room) in Chinese.

Observed through a small telescope, Beta Scorpii appears as a binary star with a separation between the two components of 13.5 arcseconds and a combined apparent magnitude of 2.50. This pair, β1 and β2, form the top branches of the hierarchy of orbiting components in this system. β1 Scorpii, the brighter of the pair, consists of two sub-components, β Sco A and β Sco B, orbiting at an angular separation of 3.9 arcseconds with an orbital period of 610 years. β Sco A is itself a spectroscopic binary with the components β Sco Aa and β Sco Ab separated by 1.42 milliarcseconds and an orbital period of 6.82 days.
The second visual component, β2 Scorpii, has two sub-components, β Sco C and β Sco E, orbiting at an angular separation of 0.1328 arcseconds with an orbital period of 39 years. β Sco E is a spectroscopic binary with the components β Sco Ea and β Sco Eb having an orbital period of 10.7 days. This brings the total number of stars in the system to six. There is no D component; this is now an artifact of earlier system models.
The two most massive members of the system have the spectrum of B-type main sequence stars. Component C has a stellar classification of B2V. They are both hot stars at least 10 times as massive as our own Sun, and will have short lives. Both are expected to end their stellar evolution with massive Type II supernova explosions.
The Beta Scorpii system is a kinematic member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a group of thousands of young stars with mean age 11 million years at distance 470 light years (145 parsecs). A recent analysis of the HR diagram position for the most massive star Beta-1 Scorpii A estimates its effective temperature to be 26,240 Kelvin with a luminosity of 19,500 Suns, consistent with an isochronal age of 11 million years and an estimated mass of 12 solar masses.

Triangulum Australe,Alpha Trianguli Australi,α,NA,NA,NA,150798,82273,1.91,−3.62,415,NA,"Alpha Trianguli Australis (α TrA, α Trianguli Australis) is the brightest star in the southern constellation Triangulum Australe, forming an apex of a triangle with Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis that gives the constellation its name (Latin for southern triangle). This star has the traditional name Atria, which is merely a contraction of its Bayer designation. In traditional Chinese it is called 三角形三 (Mandarin: sān jiǎo xín sān), the Third Star of the Triangle.
Alpha Trianguli Australis is a bright giant star with an apparent magnitude of +1.91. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located roughly 391 light-years (120 parsecs) distant from the Earth. The estimated age of the star is 48 million years old; sufficiently old for a massive star to evolve away from the main sequence and expand into a giant. It has a mass roughly seven times the mass of the Sun, but is emitting about 5,500 times the Sun's luminosity. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is 4,150 K, which gives it the characteristic orange hue of a K-type star. With a diameter 130 times that of our sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at the centre of the Solar System. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation.
There is evidence that Atria may be a binary star. It displays unusual properties for a star of its class, including stellar flares and a higher than normal emission of X-rays. These can be explained by a young, magnetically active companion with a stellar classification of about G0 V. Such a star would have a mass similar to the Sun, with an orbital period of at least 130 years. Young, G-type stars have a high temperature corona and frequently emit flares causing sudden increases in luminosity. The pair may be separated by about 50 Astronomical Units."

It is approximately 40.37 light-years (12.38 parsecs) from Earth and has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.85. This star has a relatively high rate of proper motion across the celestial sphere. It is a F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F1 V. Beta TrA has a 14th magnitude optical companion at an angular separation of 155 arcseconds.
Observation with the Spitzer Space Telescope reveals what appears to be an excess infrared emission from this star. This suggests the presence of circumstellar material in this system, making it a debris disk candidate. This star may be a member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, an association of about 17 stars that share a common origin and a similar motion through space. If it is a member of this group, this would put the age of β TrA at about 12 million years; the same as the group itself."

Along with Alpha and Beta Trianguli Australis it forms a prominent triangular asterism that gives the constellation its name (Latin for southern triangle). It is the third brightest member of this constellation with an apparent visual magnitude of +2.87. based upon parallax measurements, Gamma Trianguli Australis is located at a distance of about 184 light-years (56 parsecs) from Earth.
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of A1 V, which identifies it as an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. An unusual abundance of the element europium demonstrates it to be a peculiar, or Ap star. Most stars of this type are slow rotators, but Gamma Trianguli Australis displays a very high rate of rotation with a projected rotational velocity of 199 km s−1. It has an estimated age of 260 million years.
This system shows an excess emission of infrared radiation, suggesting that there is a circumstellar disk of dust orbiting this star. The mean temperature of the emission is 50 K, corresponding to a separation from the star of 481 AU."

Parallax measurements place it at a distance of 144.5 light-years (44.3 parsecs) from Earth. This is sufficiently close that the magnitude of the star is only reduced by 0.05 due to extinction. In Chinese astronomy, Psi Ursae Majoris is called Tien Tsan or Ta Tsun, ""Extremely Honorable"". The name was possibly derived from the word 太尊, Pinyin: Tàizūn, meaning Royals, because this star is marking itself and stand alone in Royals asterism, Purple Forbidden enclosure (see Chinese constellation).
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of K1 III, with the luminosity class of 'III' indicating this is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. As a consequence, it has expanded to around 20 times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating roughly 148 times the luminosity of the Sun from its enlarged outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,520 K. At this heat, the star glows with the orange hue of a K-type star.

It has the traditional names Talitha, Talitha Borealis and Alphikra Borealis, and was also dubbed Dnoces (""Second,"" backwards) after Edward H. White II, an Apollo 1 astronaut. The name was invented by his fellow astronaut Gus Grissom as a practical joke.
The Iota Ursae Majoris system is composed of two binary stars. The brightest component is a white A-type subgiant. It is a spectroscopic binary whose components have an orbital period of 4028 days. The companion binary is composed of the 9th magnitude and 10th magnitude stars. These two stars orbit around each other with a period of 39.7 years, and are separated by roughly 0.7 arcseconds, or at least 10 AU. This pair may be the source of the X-ray emission detected from this system.
The two binary systems orbit around each other once every 818 years. The apparent separation between the two binaries is rapidly decreasing as they follow their orbits. In 1841 when the B component was first discovered, they had a separation of 10.7 arcseconds, or at least 156 AU. By 1971 their separation had decreased to 4.5 arcseconds, or at least 66 AU.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.17, placing it among the brighter members of this constellation. The distance to this star has been measured directly using the parallax method, yielding an estimated value of 43.96 light-years (13.48 parsecs).
In 1976, this was reported as a spectroscopic binary system by Helmut A. Abt and Saul G. Levy, giving it an orbital period of 371 days. This has been listed as a spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 371 days. However, this was brought into question by Christopher L. Morbey and Roger F. Griffin in 1987, who suggested that the data could be explained by random chance. Further observations in 2009 with observations with the Bok Telescope in Arizona did show changes of 180 m/s in radial velocity, although there was not sufficient evidence to support a Keplerian orbit. There is a 14th-magnitude common proper motion companion to Theta Ursae Majoris at an angular separation of 4.1 arcseconds, so this may potentially be a triple star system.
The primary component of this putative system has a published stellar classification of F6 IV, indicating it is a subgiant star that is evolving away from the main sequence. In 2009, Helmut A. Abt listed it with a stellar classification of F7 V, suggesting that it is still on the main sequence. It is larger than the Sun with 141% of the Sun's mass and 250% of the Sun's radius. Consequently it is shining brighter and evolving more rapidly than the Sun, with a luminosity nearly eight times the Sun's at an age of 2.2 billion years. This energy is being radiated from the star's outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,300 K. At this heat, the star glows with the yellow-white hue of an F-type star.

Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of 58.4 light-years (17.9 parsecs) from Earth.
Megrez has 63% more mass of the Sun and is about 1.4 times the Sun's radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star.
This star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poynting–Robertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward.
It has two faint companions, a 10th magnitude star and an 11th magnitude star, both at an angular separation of two arcminutes from the primary.
Megrez is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud.

This star has the traditional name Muscida, which it shares with the optical double star Pi Ursae Majoris.
The stellar classification of this star, G4 II–III, places it midway between the giant and bright giant stages of its evolution. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star is about 2.42 mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 14 times the radius of the Sun. It has about three times the mass of the Sun and radiates 138 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,282 K, giving it the yellowish hue of a G-type star.
In 1963, East German astronomer Gerhard Jakisch reported this star as a variable with a period of 358 days and an amplitude of 0.08 magnitude. The 1982 edition of the New Catalogue of Suspected Variable Stars listed it with a variability from 3.30 to 3.36 in the visual band. However, in 1992 American astronomer Dorrit Hoffleit noted that the two comparison stars used to determine the variability may themselves be variable. Hence the actual variability of this star may be suspect.
Muscida has a magnitude 15.2 common proper motion companion at an angular separation of 7.1 arcseconds. With a probability of 99.4%, this companion is the source for the X-ray emission from the system. Omicron Ursae Majoris is sometimes listed with two more companions, but, based on proper motion data, these appear to be optical companions.

It comes as close to the Galactic Center as 23.5 kly (7.2 kpc) and as distant as 30.2 kly (9.3 kpc). This orbit carries it no more than about 330 ly (100 pc) above the galactic plane. It is considered a runaway star because it has a high peculiar velocity of 35.5 km s−1 relative to the typical motion of stars in its vicinity.

From parallax measurements, this system is located at a distance of roughly 572 light-years (175 parsecs) from the Earth. The apparent visual magnitude is 2.48, making it readily visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere.
This is a spectroscopic binary system consisting of a pair of stars that complete an orbit around each other with a period of 116.65 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.19. Because the individual stars have not been resolved, further details of the orbit have not yet been determined. The combined stellar classification of the pair is B2 IV, which matches the class of a B-type subgiant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and begun to evolve into a giant. It has an estimated size of 6.9 times the Sun's radius.
The star is only a couple of degrees from the south celestial pole of Mars, so it could therefore be considered the southern polar star of Mars. Due to precession of the equinoxes, it will be the closest bright star of note to the south celestial pole of Earth in the period surrounding 9000 AD.
Analysis of the spectrum for Kappa Velorum shows absorption line features from the interstellar medium between the Earth and the star. Long term observation of these features has shown variations, possibly caused by the transverse motion of an extended cloud extending 102–103 Astronomical Units."

The inner pair is a spectroscopic binary that completes an orbit with a period of 72 days. The inclination of this orbit was determined through interferometer observations to be 45.5°, which allowed the individual masses of the two stars to be estimated. The primary star, η Vir Aa, has a mass of about 2.5 times the Sun's mass, while the secondary, η Vir Ab, has 1.9 solar masses. The faint tertiary star, η Vir B, orbits the inner group in a wider orbit over a period of 13.1 years.
Because Zaniah is near the ecliptic, it can be occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. On October 12, 272 BC, the ancient Greek astronomer Timocharis observed a conjunction of the star with Venus. The last occultation by a planet took place on September 27, 1843, also by Venus, which will occult it again on November 19, 2445."

This star has a stellar classification of K2 III, with the luminosity class 'III' indicating that this is a giant star that has consumed the hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. It has a mass about double that of the Sun and has expanded to 23 times the Sun's radius, giving it a luminosity of 182 times the luminosity of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 4,395 K, which gives the star the orange hue typical of K-type stars. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is slightly higher than in the Sun.
This star has three optical companions. At an angular separation of 173.1 arcseconds is a magnitude +9.1 star, which is of spectral type K0. A 10th magnitude star is located 221.2 arcseconds away, and the third is a magnitude +9.1 K2 star 321.2 arcseconds away. None of these have been confirmed as a physical companion.
In July 2009, it was discovered that Chi Virginis has a massive planet with a high orbital eccentricity of 0.46.
